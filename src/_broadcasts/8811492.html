    <strong>10 years of blogging. Woo hoo! üéâ </strong>(<a
      href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-importance-of-crafting-your-creative-environment"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Read my first post here.</a
    >)
  </p>
  <p>
    A few interesting stats: <strong>248 posts</strong> to date (not including
    photos, podcasts, etc.).<br />Most prolific year so far: 2018 (<strong
      >86 posts</strong
    >).<br />Least prolific year: 2017 (<strong>9 posts</strong>).<br />Goal for
    2022: <em>Beat 2018! </em>üí™
  </p>
  <p>
    I know I said &quot;10 years of blogging&quot; ‚Äî but in actuality it&#x27;s
    that plus the previous ~16 years of publishing content in various forms at
    various times online‚Ä¶and before that writing &amp; publishing family
    newsletters my parents snail-mailed out to family and close friends‚Ä¶and before
    that‚Ä¶
  </p>
  <p><em>I was born.</em> üòÜ</p>
  <p>
    In all seriousness, I simply can&#x27;t remember a time I didn&#x27;t feel
    compelled to write. However,
    <a
      href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/i-am-a-writer"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >as I once explained on my blog</a
    >, I spent the majority of my time as a writer
    <strong>not realizing that I&#x27;m a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù</strong>. üßê I&#x27;ve always
    been something else‚Ä¶a musician, a web developer, a businessman, a father, a
    [fill in the blank]. And then‚Äîon the side‚Äîhey, there&#x27;s this writing
    thing. üò≤
  </p>
  <p>
    Why has it been such a challenge for me to identify as a writer? Why have
    the decades come and gone and I still waffle on why this is an important
    endeavor? Even after 10 years of (somewhat) continuous blogging on a more
    serious level, it still feels like a flimsy side-project I never fully
    commit to or prioiritize.
  </p>

    <strong
      >It&#x27;s my biggest creative regret*. But it&#x27;s not too late to turn
      this ship around.</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    * I also regret not figuring out a viable path towards gigging again and
    performing electronic music prior to the start of the pandemic, but
    I&#x27;ve since made my peace with that. (Keep reading to see why.)

  <h3>The DLTSER of Creative Endeavors</h3>
  <p><em>That sure rolls easily off the tongue!</em> üòú</p>
  <p><strong>DLTSER</strong> is an acronym I just made up which stands for:</p>
  <ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position: inside">
    <li class="list_item"><span>Difficulty Level</span></li>
    <li class="list_item"><span>Time Spent</span></li>
    <li class="list_item"><span>Emotional Reward</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words, when evaluating any creative endeavor to see if you want to
    lean into it more or hold back for the time being, you can use the
    <strong>DLTSER</strong> metric as a way of wrapping your head about
    what&#x27;s truly vital or less appealing. Here are my metrics:

    Based on the above metrics, you can see why I don&#x27;t put much regular
    effort into music production anymore. (<a
      href="https://www.yarred.com/collaborations"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >My most recent effort however</a
    >
    I think is fairly awesome.) The truth is it&#x27;s challenging work, takes
    up a lot of time, and I often feel quite drained and almost depressed after
    a session. Why do I feel this way? Who knows! On the other hand, photography
    is not as difficult, you can acheive good results fairly quickly, and I feel
    quite joyful about everything involved in the process: traveling, shooting,
    post-processing, and
    <a
      href="https://glass.photo/jaredcwhite"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >sharing photos online</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Video production is an example of something that&#x27;s difficult &amp; time
    consuming like music production, yet vlogging is something I really enjoy
    for the most part. And I <em>love</em> going back and rewatching past
    videos. For now it&#x27;s on hold, but I hope to get back to it before too
    long.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Take a look at writing though!</strong> For a creative endavor with
    the most &quot;bang for your buck,&quot; it simply can&#x27;t be beat.
    It&#x27;s easy to do, you don&#x27;t need to spend much time on it if you
    don&#x27;t want to, yet the emotional rewards are quite significant.
    <em>I&#x27;m always glad I wrote</em>. I never sit down for a writing
    session, and then after a while think &quot;Gosh, that sucked. If only
    I&#x27;d vegged out watching Netflix and eating potato chips instead!&quot;
    üòÖ
  </p>
  <p>
    So I&#x27;m doubling down this year on writing and really trying to make the
    effort to do it well, do it consistently, and
    <strong>do it consistently well</strong>. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
