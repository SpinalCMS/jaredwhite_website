This has been a year of extremes. Some of the most emotionally painful and gut-wrenching moments I've been through in close to a decade. But also some of the most thrilling and rewarding times in my entire life. For all of my journey, for the yin and the yang, for the growth, for the joy, for the loss, for the art, for the loveâ€¦I am truly THANKFUL. ðŸ™Œ
