One of my favorite #synthmusic artists is Jerome Froese, formerly of Tangerine Dream fame. He joined the group at the end of the 80s during a period of tremendous stylistic and technological change. His father Edgar originally founded TD in the late 60s, so you can imagine twenty years later there was much that was different about the "vibe" of the band (much to the chagrin of many long-time fans).

Nevertheless, I would argue and few would deny that one of the big highlights of 90s-era TD was the *Dream Mixes* series, principally composed and spearheaded by Jerome. Of this series, DM II is probably my favorite. It's a heady blend of techno, drum&bass, chill, world fusion, and other styles that got big in the 90s, yet with an overall depth and sensibility that evokes the greatness of classic Berlin School electronica.

[Jerome has released a newly remastered 2019 edition of Dream Mixes II](https://jeromefroese.bandcamp.com/album/dream-mixes-ii-ultimate-edition-remastered-2018), and I highly recommend it. I'm listening to it right now, and it sounds *fabulous*.
