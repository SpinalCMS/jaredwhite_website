So you can take the Portland Aerial Tram up to the OSHU complex near Stonehenge radio tower, which I knew, but what I *didn't* know is you can veer right as soon as you get off the tram and walk along an AMAZING patio area that overlooks the whole frickin' Willamette Valley/Portland areaâ€”cafe tables and all.

Oh I'm coming back up here, no doubt about it!
