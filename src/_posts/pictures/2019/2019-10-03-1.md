MKBHD [got a sneak peek at the latest Surface hardware](https://youtu.be/omyZvH7aMtg) over at  Microsoft Labs: the **Surface Neo** along with its smaller sibling the **Surface Duo**. These devices won't get into consumers' hands until "Holiday 2020" so this is definitely future tech. But, judging from the video showing how they look and function, I'll go on record saying this is the first "foldable" design that gets me excited.

I don't think the Samsung Galaxy Fold or any of the other smartphone designs with foldable screens we've seen thus far make any sense. But Microsoft's take here of a small tablet that becomes a big tablet with the dual-screen design and 360 degree hinge is _very_ interesting. Now I kinda want a dual-screen iPad Pro mini. ü§ì
