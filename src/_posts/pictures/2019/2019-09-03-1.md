I can't believe I captured this image. It looks like something straight out of a travel brochure.

Really, the credit goes to Silver Falls State Park thoughâ€”one of the most beautiful places I've visited yet in Oregon. I can't wait to go back in the spring when the volume of water going over the falls will no doubt be much greater!
