I was messing around with ZenBrush on my new iPad Pro and this emerged. I apologize in advance to any Chinese calligraphy experts out there…I have no idea what I'm doing! This is supposed to say “Serenity.” Hopefully I didn't botch it completely. Anyway, ZenBrush is an amazing app. (This is straight out of the device—it's not actually a canvas hanging up in an art gallery! 😲) #iPadPro #creativity
