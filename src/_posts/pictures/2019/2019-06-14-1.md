Last weekend we took a family jaunt over to Broughton Beach. It's on the Oregon side of the Columbia River just west of PDX airport.

Let's just say I'm a *huge fan* of river beaches now. You get most of the fun of the oceanside without the crazy waves and wind! (And hour+ drive from Portlandâ€¦)
