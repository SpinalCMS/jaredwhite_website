Due to circumstances somewhat beyond my control, I had to upgrade my #iPhone from a 7 Plus to a XR (Coral, looks dope). The enchanced photo processing combined with the wide gamut display means photos like this really pop! I do miss the 2X zoom lens from my iPhone 7 Plus, but otherwise, the iPhone XR is a really solid product and I'm enjoying it tremendously.
