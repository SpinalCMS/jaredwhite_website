Welp, this is a thing now. First draft of my design for a new blog and course learning all about Stimulus, a lightweight Javascript framework from the Basecamp folks. I've really enjoyed working with it for over a year now…it's made coding web frontends so much nicer!

Hoping to get the #website launched ASAP…possibly in February if I can keep up the momentum.
