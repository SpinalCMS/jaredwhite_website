I had the opportunity to take my family on a tour of the U.S.S. Portland, docked here in its namesake city for a formal commissioning. A fine #ship it is! We got to meet some of the crew and see quite a few areas in nearly all decks. Also enjoyed the lovely weather after nearly a week of rain! #portland
