The other day, I pulled out my #Canon EOS-M mirrorless camera with a 50mm prime lens. I'd been feeling like I was lazy just relying on my iPhone all the time for photography (although it amazes me how good smartphone photograph is these days). Anyway, I had a lot of fun using a dedicated camera with a beefy lens once again, and this shot was just icing on the cake.
