title: Ready to Join the Movement to Restore Speed, Simplicity, and Elegance
  to the Web?

link_excerpt: If you’re tired of codebases which mushroom in complexity until they’re
  unmaintainable over the long term due to Hype-Driven Development…if you’re weary
  of practices which make the open web feel like a morass of numbers-driven “experiences”
  and subtle vendor lock-in…if you yearn for the days when a prudent employment of
  open web standards and “conceptual compression” could unlock delightful experiences
  outpacing much larger rivals…then join us.

I understand that to some of my readers, my new business website will come across as a bunch of incomprehensible techno-babble. Don't worry—if that's the case, you're not my target demographic. 😄 This site is by a developer, for developers. My goal is to connect with like-minded people and organizations who are building the future of the web. Ping me if you fit the bill!
