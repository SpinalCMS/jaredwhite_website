Despite the extremely rocky road that #cryptocurrency has traversed this year, I remain very bullish on this technology. I believe the future of #finance and transactional systems is clearly on the side of software-based monetary constructs, and no other company I'm aware of is better positioned right now to drive us toward that future than Coinbase. (Full disclosure: I own a _very_ modest amount of cryptocurrency.)

#portland has been a hotbed for financial startups for quite a while now ([Simple](https://www.simple.com) is but one example), so it makes a great deal of sense for Coinbase to establish a large presence here. Hopefully that will serve to strengthen the fintech industry here overall.
