title: "@jared@openweb.social on Mastodon"
link_excerpt: "The \"business model\" (if any) and development model of Mastodon vs.
  App.net (may it rest in peace) is radically different…however I see them as both
  fulfilling the same important need on the web: aligning the goals of a social network
  with the needs of its community, rather than the actual paying customers of nearly
  all proprietary social networks: advertisers.\r\n\r\nMastodon is nothing without
  the community. And I *love* that."

So I've been on Mastodon, the #openweb federated social network, for a while now. I've seen it grow and grow, and lately with all the wackiness with Nazis and other unsavory characters on Twitter—combined with the mind-numbing lack of awareness on the part of Twitter's top brass—I'm seeing a ton of "influencers" in the tech/geek crowd migrating over to Mastodon. It's very exciting. What's also exciting is I decided to set up my own instance of Mastodon! It's called (*oh how I love that I was able to snag this domain name*): **OpenWeb.social**. The link above lets you see my account there, and you're welcome to [sign up on the instance](https://openweb.social) if you want to try out Mastodon yourself. I'll be happy to show you around!
