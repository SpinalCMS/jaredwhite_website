link_title: 'Review: Season 4 of Amazon’s Unstoppable Cop Drama “Bosch”'
link_excerpt: "In its fourth season, “Bosch” remains as good and solid as its namesake
  hero. The creation of author Michael Connelly, good ol’ Det. Hieronymus “Harry”
  Bosch (Titus Welliver) is a no-excuses cop who is haunted by his past, but you wouldn’t
  know it because he’s also incredibly businesslike. He’s not crippled by his obsessions
  nor addictions, he’s not a quirky savant with exceptional detecting skills, and
  he’s not in any way an obnoxious attention seeker.\r\n\r\nInstead, his appeal is
  that he does his job without fanfare and as honestly and implacably as possible,
  while occasionally overextending himself. And so too does “Bosch” the series. It’s
  why it was Amazon’s top-watched original series for several years until “Sneaky
  Pete” sneaked in: “Bosch” is so reliable in how pure and straightforward it is that
  a series-altering event in the first half of the season is actually shocking when
  it happens. More on this later, but we promise no spoilers."

This show is hands down my favorite "nitty-gritty" detective show. I've enjoyed the past three seasons considerably, but this one that just dropped is not only equal in quality to its predecessors but exhibits some of the most compelling acting from its lead characters to date.

One of the best aspects of the show is the father-daughter relationship between "Harry" Bosch and Maddie, now an adult of 18 years. The basic goodness of their rapport and the depth of care they have for each another is a rare gem in TV storytelling. The Bosch duo is the heart of the show and a light that remains even in the midst of crime, corruption, and darkness.
