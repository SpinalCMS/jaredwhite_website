title: Handwritten Score from Handel’s Messiah
link_excerpt: The notes on these pages show Handel hastily adapting an aria in his
  most famous oratorio. He conducted performances from this score, including the first
  (in Dublin, 13 April 1742). It was copied from Handel’s original manuscript by his
  amanuensis, John Christopher Smith the Elder, but these two pages are wholly in
  the hand of the composer. Handel often altered the score to suit each performance,
  adding names of singers and new versions of some sections.

Seeing an actual manuscript by Handel to one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written is something truly special (even if it's only in digital form).
