title: Facebook wants to become your internet service provider
link_excerpt: Facebook and Qualcomm are working together to provide high-speed connectivity
  to urban areas. The goal is to provide multi-gigabytes per second speed at a lower
  cost. Terragraph will use Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) to replace cable or fiber
  connections.  Subscribers will have a home access point that then broadcasts Wi-Fi
  to a Mac, iPad, etc. “With Terragraph, our goal is to enable people living in urban
  areas to access high-quality connectivity that can help create new opportunities
  and strengthen communities,” Yael Maguire, vice president of connectivity, Facebook.

Facebook's working on several significant internet connectivity solutions right now. Terragraph is their newest experiment. My simple take on these initiatives is this: as long as #Facebook ensures their ISP division only provides a "dumb pipe" that allows *all* internet traffic through without modification or prioritization, then I think their efforts are a good thing. But somehow I suspect what we'll really get is internet that's free because it's subsidized by Facebook ad tech and prioritizes fast access to Facebook.
