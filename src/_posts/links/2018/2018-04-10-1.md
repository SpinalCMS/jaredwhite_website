link_title: The Minimalists Interview Derek Sivers
link_excerpt: "In this episode of The Minimalists Podcast, Joshua & Ryan chat with
  Derek Sivers about simplicity, complexity, parenting, creativity, and saying “no”
  to almost everything, and they answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n* How do I
  prioritize the most important things in my life once I’ve eliminated the clutter?\r\n*
  How do I say ‘no’ to gifts and donations from my loved ones for my newborn without
  looking like an unappreciative jerk?\r\n* How do I stay present with my loved ones
  when there are so many pressing demands on my time from my professional life?\r\n*
  How do I ensure I stay committed to my minimalism journey?"

Derek Sivers is perhaps best known for starting CDBaby and being a big part of the independent music scene in the early days of the web, but he's written and presented a lot since then on topics related to creativity, entrepreneurship, and leadership. Always a treat hearing him speak. (There's a fair bit of preamble in this episode so you may want to skip to the 18:00 mark to get to the interview.) #minimalism
