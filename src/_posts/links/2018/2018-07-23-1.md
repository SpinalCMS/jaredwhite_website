link_excerpt: "Not everyone finds it easy to put pen to paper (so to speak). Perhaps
  your plate is so full you’re ready to delegate your writing tasks to a dedicated
  producer.\r\n\r\nWhatever situation you’re in, I’m here to help. I can take your
  raw ideas, the inception stages of your content pipeline, and transform them into
  professional, polished work.\r\n\r\nAn essay. A short post. A social media quiz.
  An inspirational quote. An in-depth tutorial. No matter what the need is, whether
  it’s 1500 words or 15, I’m up for the challenge.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be proud to take
  the original content I provide and share it with your growing audience."

I realize how terribly self-indulgent it is to link to myself on the blog here, but I'm starting to get the word out that I'm now available for hire as a freelance writer. If you're looking for original content production, I'd greatly appreciate your review of my services and portfolio.
