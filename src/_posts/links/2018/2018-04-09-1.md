I'm still a huge fan of the iPhone 7/8 form factor, and *oh wow* that looks incredible. Remember how the previous RED edition fronts were white, and what everyone was actually drooling over were some mockups floating around that had a black front instead? I'm so glad #Apple listened to that feedback. As cool as the iPhone X is, this in my opinion is the most stunning #iPhone they've ever made.
