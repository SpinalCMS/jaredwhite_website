link_title: Jekyll’s Hidden Depths
link_excerpt: As anyone who has used Jekyll for a while knows, it's capable of so
  much more than first meets the eye. Jekyll is an amazingly powerful content system
  right out of the box. But with a few added plugins or creative uses of existing
  features, it can do almost anything imaginable. I’ve built a wide variety of websites
  on top of Jekyll over the last couple of years and I still feel like I’m learning
  new tricks every day.
