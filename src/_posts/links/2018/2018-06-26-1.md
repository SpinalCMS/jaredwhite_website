title: Everything you can imagine is real
link_excerpt: Justin Peters takes stock photos and combines them into fantastical
  and mind-bending scenes. Iâ€™ve seen lots of this sort of thing, but these are particularly
  well done. The one with the umbrella and the road is a straight-up optical illusion
  and broke my brain for awhile.

Photographic artwork that mainly serves as a way to show off optical illusions or slick Photoshop skills is usually pretty uninteresting to me, but these images are so creative and well-executed, I was drawn to them immediately. #creativity
