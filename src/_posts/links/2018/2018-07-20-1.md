title: A History of the Classical Guitar
link_excerpt: "During the five centuries of the classical guitar’s existence, the
  instrument has completely changed in physical dimensions, shape, stringing, and
  tuning.\r\n\r\nWhile a guitarist of the Renaissance may have played their way through
  delightful court music on a tiny instrument designed for strumming, by the time
  the 20th century rolled around the guitar had increased drastically in size and
  totally changed construction. You’d be more likely to hear an avant-garde sonata
  than courtly trifles. Somehow, these incredibly dissimilar instruments both come
  under the category of “classical guitar.”"

I've known the basic contours of the guitar's history for a long time, but this helped fill in a lot of the gaps in my knowledge and was very enjoyable to read. The YouTube video examples are fantastic as well.
