title: 'Seth Godin: the steering wheel and the guardrails'
link_excerpt: "Capitalism is an extraordinary engine. It has remade every corner of
  the Earth, and done it in the course of two or three lifetimes. Together with its
  cousins, technology and industrialism, capitalism is an evolving system that changes
  whatever it touches.\r\n\r\nBut the purpose of our society isn’t to optimize capitalism.
  The purpose of capitalism is to allow our society to become better. A culture that
  opens doors for and nurtures the people we care about."

I've been thinking a lot lately about the basic "pitch" of capitalism and the financial system we have in America—not in a negative sense, but in more of a greenfield "how can this be improved" sort of way. In other words, if capitalism were a product (like an iPhone or a Tesla Model S), how could it be upgraded? How could it be changed? How might it adapt to the natural evolution of a society? As Seth Godin points out, capitalism is an engine for tremendous growth and ingenunity. But we also need to be honest about its "dark patterns" and negative effects, and try to resolve those shortcomings while simultaneously maximizing its potential for human flourishing.
