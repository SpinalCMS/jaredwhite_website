link_title: Democrats’ blue wave was much larger than early takes suggested
link_excerpt: "Like in any election, Democrats both won some squeakers and lost some
  squeakers. They overperformed expectations in some races and underperformed them
  in others. And in 2018, it happens to be the case that Democrats got some of their
  most disappointing results in East Coast states with early closing times, while
  the GOP’s biggest disappointments came disproportionately in late-counting states.\r\n\r\nConsequently,
  what felt to many like a disappointment as of 11 pm Eastern time on election night
  now looks more and more like a triumph."

I think reasonable people on all sides of the political spectrum can agree on one thing: political news coverage—*especially* on television—is heavily skewed towards sensationalism and knee-jerk reactions instead of deep analysis and factual reporting. Whether or not you believe in a "blue wave" last week, it's clear that the rhetoric on both sides during the early election results failed to provide any meaningful coverage of what was really going on among the electorate. It's looking like it'll take weeks, if not months, to gain a clear picture of what this election means for U.S. politics going forward. #politics
