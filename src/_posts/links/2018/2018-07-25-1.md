I've been following the news of odd performance glitches with the top-of-the-line (Intel i9-based) MacBook Pros from #Apple, and (like everyone) speculating what might be going on. I certainly hoped there was some kind of software issue at play here and not a faulty hardware design. But I assumed if that were the case, it would be at the OS level…maybe Apple would release an update to macOS to improve performance on these particular models. Instead, Apple released a firmware update to supply a "missing digital key" — the lack of which had a negative effect on "the thermal management system". It's definitely not good PR for Apple to have this sort of QA oversight result in a news cycle of pointed commentary on the slow performance of its flagship laptops. But I'm glad the fix appears to be a relatively simple one.
