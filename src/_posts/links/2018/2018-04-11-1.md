link_title: Instagram Will Soon Let You Download a Copy of Your Data
link_excerpt: The new data portability tool could make it much easier for users to
  leave Instagram and go to a competing image social network. It will also help the
  site comply with the upcoming European GDPR privacy law that requires data portability,
  assuming the feature launches before May 25th.

One significant thing that #Facebook did right is to allow users to download an archive of everything they posted on the network. I feel like the format of the data export is rather poor and in some cases hard for software to parse for interesting analysis, but it's certainly better than nothing. I'm glad to hear #Instagram (which is owned by Facebook) is following suit. However, I generally don't [post anything to Instagram myself](https://www.instagram.com/pygmynuthatch/) that's not already in my #iPhone's photo library, and I suspect that might be the case for a lot of Instagram users, so I'm curious what besides the photos & videos themselves will be included in the archive.
