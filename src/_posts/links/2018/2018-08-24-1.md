link_title: Tim Cook's Apple
link_excerpt: "Tim Cook wasn't and isn't a product person, not like Jobs. He didn't
  dream up the next world-changing device. What he did was make those dreams a reality.
  Famously, he didn't invent the iPad. He figured out how to make it for $500.\r\n\r\nIt
  would have been easy for Cook and his cool, steady Southern charm, to have continued
  as CEO much as he had as COO â€” running things by the numbers. But, even early on,
  Cook showed signs of something more."

A good summary by Rene Ritchie on Tim Cook's seven year tenure as CEO of Apple.

In my opinion, Cook has been a better CEO than Steve Jobs. Jobs was a jerk, but he was also a creative visionary. Cook is neither a jerk nor a visionary, but he's able to effectively lead visionary people at Apple while also standing for vital principles such as privacy and security.
