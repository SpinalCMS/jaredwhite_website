title: The Soul’s Objective Union with God
link_excerpt: Grace can only be trusted by an equally graceful human nature. Our work
  is merely to till the fertile soil, knowing that the Indwelling Spirit has already
  been planted within, and She is the One who “teaches you all things and reminds
  you of all things” (John 14:26). Many Christians have tried to pile a positive theology
  of salvation on top of a very negative anthropology of the human person, and it
  just does not work. The human self-image is too damaged and distorted within such
  a framework.

In my personal experiences of dealing with mental health issues and stuggling with shame and self-worth, I've come to the conclusion that the doctrine of "original sin" is dangerous, deeply problematic from a "Jesus' ministry"-centric viewpoint, and at the end of the day *not even necessary* for an incredibly rich and vibrant Christian faith.

For more observations on this topic, I'll point you to my [interview with Danielle Shroyer, author of *Original Blessing*](https://trellismagazine.com/vol/1/issue/1/fount-of-every-blessing-interview-danielle-shroyer).
