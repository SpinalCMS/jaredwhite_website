link_title: As easy as 1,2,3…
link_excerpt: In every day life we all do our calculations, whether for the taxman,
  our purchases, paying the household bills or in some academic discipline, using
  the place value decimal number system. It consists of just ten symbols (numerals)
  – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 – with which we can express any number, of any size that we
  may require. The value of the symbol changes according to its position – place –
  within the number that we write. This is an incredibly powerful and efficient method
  of writing numbers and the algorithms that it uses also make it a very efficient
  system for conducting calculations.

What a facinating read about the history of our number writing system! It's so easy to take how we represent numeric values and how we do even basic math for granted; we forget that this was all invented at certain times by certain people hundreds or thousands of years ago.
