title: Merged! Microsoft's $7.5 Billion Pull Request for GitHub
link_excerpt: The acquisition provides a way forward for San Francisco-based GitHub,
  which has been trying for nine months to find a new chief executive officer and
  has yet to make a profit from its popular service that allows coders to share and
  collaborate on their work. It also helps Microsoft, which is increasingly relying
  on open-source software, to add programming tools and tie up with a company that
  has become a key part of the way Microsoft writes its own software.

So many conflicting emotions! A lot of developers are shell shocked at this news, although there's nothing really shocking about the announcement. Microsoft has gone through a huge cultural shift over the past decade, from a company with a famously antagonistic attitude towards open source software to a company that's a leading contributor and supporter of open source. It makes a heck of a lot of sense for Microsoft to aquire _the_ platform that powers modern code collaboration. And financially, it's certainly a big win for GitHub. The problem here is that is been _bad enough_ that so many open source repositories and development workflows have been built around a proprietary, commerical entity. Now that entity will be **Microsoft**. It's not hard to speculate that a lot of open source software teams and proponents of free (aka libre) software principles will be seriously reconsidering the tools they're using in light of this acquisition.
