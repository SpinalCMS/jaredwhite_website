title: GitHub offices redesigned
link_excerpt: Rapt Studio’s architects jettisoned the space’s man-cave décor and replaced
  it with an eclectic mix of modern furniture. In lieu of the trendy shipping-container
  cubicles that had been there since 2015, there are now cozy spaces designed like
  residential living rooms. They’ve also built a room for nursing mothers, a prayer
  room, and gender-inclusive bathrooms. In the library, there are even sculptures
  of female trailblazers in computing. While GitHub’s workforce is still predominantly
  male, the redesign reflects CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath’s ambition to foster
  a more inclusive workforce.

My god, the ergonomics of these newly designed spaces look absolutely terrible. We've known for decades now that having a small screen and keyboard on a table where you have to crane your neck down all the time (aka how most people use laptops in open offices and cafés) promotes a horrible posture and will cause major structural problems over time. Those weird bed/pod things litterly make my spine hurt just looking at them.

Where the hell can you just sit at a desk, look at a big screen directly in front of you (let's say an nice Retina iMac), have a decent keyboard try at elbow level, and use a chair that allows for proper setup of lumbar support, arm rests, mesh back for muscle cooling, etc.? I would _never_ work full-time in a place like this. Never.
