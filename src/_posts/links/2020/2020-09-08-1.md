link_excerpt: Apple has officially announced its upcoming “Time Flies” event for September
  15th, and the company hid a neat augmented reality Easter egg in the event announcement
  that uses Apple’s ARKit to turn the swirling Apple logo into a floating image of
  the “9.15” event date.

This is really fun! (Click the Easter Egg link in the article while on your iPhone/iPad.)

Putting on my speculation cap, here’s what I’m hoping to see on the 9/15 #Apple event:

* #iPadPro inspired #iPhone 12 (duh)
* Cheap iPad but with new Pro styling
* “AirPhones”
* More affordable Watch options
* Teaser (or beyond!) of first Apple Silicon #Mac
* A new app surprise of some kind (Terminal for iPadOS? 😎)
  * (Honestly Logic and/or MainStage for iPadOS would be pretty sweet. FPC X would be a stretch, but a man can dream…)
