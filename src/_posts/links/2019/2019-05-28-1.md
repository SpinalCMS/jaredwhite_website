title: The Invisible Web Master
link_excerpt: _Geoffrey Ellis:_ I’ve had some valuable collaborations with other flute
  makers and musicians throughout my career, but one of my longest, ongoing collaborations
  is nearly invisible. We take so much about the internet for granted. Having a website
  is such a normal thing that we rarely give it a second thought. But having a really
  great website can be an artisan’s most impactful tool, because it is the window
  through which the world views our work. My work with Jared has really shown me the
  value of having a knowledgable and talented collaborator to make my work visible.

Geoffrey Ellis is a master artisan flute maker based in northern California. I consider Geoffrey Ellis a good friend and long-time collaborator, and his impromptu write-up of our work together over the years is humbling and much appreciated. If you are at all a folk musician of any sort, you *must* try one of Ellis' flutes. They're physically gorgeous and sonically outstanding.
