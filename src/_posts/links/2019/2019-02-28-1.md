link_excerpt: Steve Jobs pitched widgets as mini-apps that let you look up a quick
  bit of information without ruining your workflow or train of thought. They allowed
  for quick interactions. They were present when you needed them, and disappeared
  when you didn’t.

This is an oldie but goodie from 2016, in which Stephen Hackett breaks down the origins of **Dashboard**: a feature which first came to macOS in the days of 10.4 "Tiger"—and with it a suprisingly robust set of enhancements to the web itself (because Dashboard widgets were actually miniature web pages!).

I'm sharing this because I would really like to see a *2019* take on Dashboard for the Mac, but even more than that, I would love to see an iOS-variant of this concept come to the iPad this year. I relish the thought of dedicating my iPad home screen to a variety of widgets. Maybe the widgets that are already available in the **Today View** could be expanded upon visually and worked into a more freeform Dashboard-like concept. At any rate, even though Dashboard itself is legacy technology barely holding on for dear life, I think the concept continues to have merit and deserves a modern overhaul for both Mac and iOS.
