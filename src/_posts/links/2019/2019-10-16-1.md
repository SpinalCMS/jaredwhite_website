title: Many Americans are unsure about a number of digital topics
link_excerpt: A new Pew Research Center survey finds that Americansâ€™ understanding
  of technology-related issues varies greatly depending on the topic, term or concept.
  While a majority of U.S. adults can correctly answer questions about phishing scams
  or website cookies, other items are more challenging.

Well, another equally valid headline would have been *Many Americans are unsure about a number of topics*. ðŸ˜œ

Sereiously though, of interest to me is the stat that **only 29% of those interviewed correctly identified #Facebook as the owner of both Instagram and WhatsApp**. This is hugely problematic not only from the perspective of consumers understanding their choices around smartphone app usage, but it's a major issue for Facebook as well. Facebook's brand has become tarnished in recent years, yet it continues to move towards tighter integration of WhatsApp and Instagram into the Facebook platform and ecosystem. However, this could end up backfiring as people increasingly question their usage of the more "positive" apps which have escaped some of the ire directed at Facebook.

Every time I talk with a friend or colleague about how I'm not on Facebook but still use Instagram, I immediately add "yeah I know, it's still part of Facebook." Most of the time the folks I talk to know this already, but most of the folks I talk to are fairly digitally savvy. Farther afield, I fear a great many people just have no idea that even when they're using Instagram or WhatsApp, the buck still ends with Zuck.
