link_title: Gitea - Git with a cup of tea
link_excerpt: Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub,
  Bitbucket, and Gitlab. The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest,
  and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can
  be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms and architectures
  that Go supports. This support includes Linux, macOS, and Windows, on architectures
  like amd64, i386, ARM, PowerPC, and others.

My latest fun geek project in my ongoing quest to use self-hosted, _libre_ #openweb apps as much as possible is installing Gitea on a DigitalOcean server. I've used either Bitbucket or GitHub for hosting all my code repositories (including this #website), but I'm planning to transfer them over to my own Gitea-powered server going forward. The great thing is, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (which I use to publish static sites) supports custom Git servers. Simply install the SSH key they provide, add a webhook to your repository settings on Gitea, and **it just works**! I'm a happy camper.
