title: 'Move over, Facebook and Twitter: it''s time to bring back the blog'
link_excerpt: "A decade ago, blogging was a big deal. Web users would bookmark the
  sites of the blogs they liked, and would check them frequently. Sometimes you'd
  even subscribe to a blogger's mailing list to be notified of a new post.\r\n\r\nThen
  came Facebook, and increased centralization of content on the internet. This included
  sites like Medium, which aggregate and curate writers' content, and then sell it
  to readers behind a paywall.\r\n\r\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson's had enough. The web
  developer, bestselling author and the CTO of popular project-management software
  company Basecamp has decided to take his popular blog, Signal v. Noise, off Medium.
  He's started publishing it on his own site, for free. And yes, you can sign up for
  his mailing list, too."

I was very skeptical of the move to Medium when [Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com) first jumped on that platform, so I'm super excited to see this classic blog from the Basecamp folks return to full independence. I _love_ the new design as well.

Also, as someone who really, truly dislikes long tweetstorms (honestly, if you have more tweets to convey a singular thought than you can count on one hand, start a blog!), I can't welcome this trend wholeheartedly enough.
