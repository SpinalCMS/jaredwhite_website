Haters gonna hate, but the thing is I **liked** _The Last Jedi_â€”even more than some others such as (shock, gasp, horror) _The Return of the Jedi_. ðŸ˜±

But it felt smallâ€¦half of it takes place in outer space or on a small island.

All I want from _The Rise of Skywalker_ is a feeling of BIG **BIG** ***BIG***.
