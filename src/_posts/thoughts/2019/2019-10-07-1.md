I'm back from hiatus and currently in post-production for the next episode of **The Jared White Show**. Trying out a whole new topic: dealing with mental health struggles (depression, anxiety, etc.) while working as a creative freelancer. I know a lot of you have similar challenges, so I hope this episode will provide some insight and food for thought as you work on your path. Stay tunedâ€¦
