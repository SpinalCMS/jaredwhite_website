I tend to be very skeptical of any study, teaching, or philosophy that contains language like "women tend to be like this" or "women tend to want to do that" or "women will think like this rather than that". Why? Because women have been so marginalized throughout history that many have internalized what societal expectations are *for* them, rather than who they *really* are. So don't look at the average results. Look at the outliers. The women kicking butt and taking names. The women defying all expectations. *Those* women are far more indicative of the future of humanity!
