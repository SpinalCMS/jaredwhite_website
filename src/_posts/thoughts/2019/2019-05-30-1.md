I'm currently in the process of uploading all my #vlog episodes to date to Vimeo. I've decided that as part of my #openweb content strategy, I'm going to post videos there and "syndicate" some of them to YouTube (and Patreon).

In this scenario, Vimeo is simply a hosting company I pay for, so ultimately the canonical home for my vlog _is my own website_. As it should be!
