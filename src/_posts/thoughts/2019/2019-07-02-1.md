Yo! I'm back from various work/family/travel obligations with a renewed vigor to get into a full weekly production schedule on both the podcast and video shows. There are a few major initiatives in the hopper which I'll be announcing very soon. Part of what I've been trying to do is make publishing videos and publishing podcasts feel very similar in the sense that everything connects properly to my #website and is entered into my own content management system. (Yay for the IndieWeb!)

Along these lines, [I now have a dedicated video page on my website](https://jaredwhite.com/videos)! This is now **the canonical location** for all video going forward. I'll continue to post segments of shows I do on YouTube, Instagram, and elsewhere, but the full videos will always be on my own site and hosted on Vimeo.

In summary, I have a plan and I'm putting it into action. :) You'll see the fruits of my labor very soon‚Ä¶
