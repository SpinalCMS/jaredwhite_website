Ooo boyâ€¦. On a whim, I tried watching _A Simple Favor_ starring Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick (streaming on Prime or Hulu), and man, that ending really and truly sucked. But more than that, it only served to underscore just how shockingly good _Barry_ is (HBO series).

Both are dark comedies with thriller elements, but every episode of _Barry_ feels like a work of art. _A Simple Favor_ is nothing more than a botched popcorn flick.

To Bill Hader, Sarah Goldberg, and Alec Berg, I say: well done! The quality of your work puts many high-profile Hollywood films to shame.
