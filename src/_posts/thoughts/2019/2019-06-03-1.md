Things I'm most excited for at #Apple #WWDC 2019:

* #iOS "Pro" for #iPadPro
* New Safari/WebKit features across all platforms #openweb
* UIKit on the Mac (aka "Marzipan") #macOS
* iOS Dark Mode
* Mac Pro hardware teaser
* Some sort of indication of future notebooks that don't suck
* Dedicated App Store for Watch
* tvOS ðŸ˜œ
