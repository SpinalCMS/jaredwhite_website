**First-world problem alert:**

My freelance web agency has so much work right now, I'm sort of reeling trying to determine the best way to manage it all. I'll have to bring *all* of my timeboxing and lifehacking skills to bear in order to avoid feeling like a trainwreck by Friday.

It's a good problem to have right now with my business, butâ€¦boy oh boy do I have my work cut out for me! ðŸ¤ª Wish me luckâ€¦
