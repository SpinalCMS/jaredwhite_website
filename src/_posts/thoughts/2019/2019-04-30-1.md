If all the people out there who complain about how "blogging/
RSS/websites/whatever" is dead and we're all stuck with "Twitter/Facebook/whatever" â€” quit those services and used blogs,  Mastodon, and other open web services, we'd be back to where we were before: a vibrant online content ecosystem free of aggressive corporate dominance and a data-sucking ad-tracking hellscape.

It all starts with us: we the people. Join the revolution!
