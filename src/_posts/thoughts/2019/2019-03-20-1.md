So much of internet discourse ends up:

* I believe in Position A! You people are wrong!
* I believe in Position B! You people are wrong!
* Well, I believe in the One True Position, which of course is C. You people are both wrong!

I wish more people would instead speak up and say:

* I appreciate interesting observations from people who believe Positions A, B, C, and beyond. Let's celebrate this conversation and sharing of ideas!

(And if you disagree with me, you are, of course, WRONG! ðŸ¤£)
