Right before the keynote on Monday started, I posted [“Things I’m most excited for at Apple WWDC 2019”](https://jaredwhite.com/20190603/1). How did I do with the wish list? Well, let's say it was a very, very good day. 😁 I just recorded a podcast episode where I break it all down and that'll be going out later today. Stay tuned! #Apple #WWDC
