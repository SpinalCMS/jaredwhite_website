Now that [Bird e-scooters have come](http://www.wweek.com/news/2018/07/26/e-scooters-are-on-the-streets-and-theyre-already-getting-mixed-reviews/) to #portland, I was finally able to see what all the fuss is about. Infrastrucure and safety issues asideâ€¦wow, these are *fun* to ride! I got the same thrill of excitement when accelerating as I did when I first tried an e-assist bike a couple of years ago. I didn't go very far because I forgot to bring a helmet and didn't want to tempt fate, but I can definitely imagine using these a **lot** whenever I come into town (as long as I remember to bring my helmet!).
