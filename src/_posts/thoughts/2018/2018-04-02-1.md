I've been up for the last several hours getting all my #Jekyll build scripts and #Rails editor UIs working for the new #website. I could go into all the geeky details of the problems I've had to work through and how everything is put together, but I'll save some of that for later installments. Suffice it to say...I'm very excited about how it's turning out. 😁
