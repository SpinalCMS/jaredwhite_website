Going through a bit of a rough patch this month...reason isn't important, but what is important is just how much I'm having to wrestle with my brain to stay positive and focused. I almost had a full-blown panic attack earlier this week because I let worry and dark ruminations get the better of me. But I'm making headway by challenging myself to get more sleep, spend more time on exercise, and do something creative and fun every day to recharge my batteries. Living in the now beats battling fictional tomorrows any day! #mindfulness
