Big news! I purchased the domain name **openweb.social**, which I'm simply thrilled was still available. I'm mulling over a few ideas of what to do with it. One possibility is that I'll install [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) to power a new #openweb themed social network where people can discuss building a better community of content publishing and engagement via open protocols.

Another possibility that I'm just starting to tinker with is starting a *what-if* #website that deep-dives into the question of what it would take for #Facebook to adopt open protocols. What if you could take your "social graph" to another service (even one you built yourself!) and post content there, and your Facebook friends could still see your posts? And you'd still see your friends' Facebook posts and even reply to them? It would make social networking more akin to email, where all email clients and servers are compatible even though they're run by different companies and on different infrastructure.

Got any thoughts? Just click **Message** above (or reply to this email if you're reading my newsletter) and let me know what _you_ think I should do with **openweb.social**!
