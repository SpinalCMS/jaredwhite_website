I'm afraid I've neglected posting much here in the past few days, but it was all for a good cause. After over a year of false starts and tinkering, [I have finally launched a brand new website for my company Whitefusion](https://whitefusion.io). My "day job" is designing websites and building software for startups, non-profits, and forward-thinking organizations, and for quite a while I had been suffering from the "shoemaker's children have no shoes" syndrome. Everyone else was getting shiny new work, and my own business was suffering. Well no longer! I'm extremely proud of how the site turned out, and I'm excited about what's in store for this new chapter of Whitefusion. #website
