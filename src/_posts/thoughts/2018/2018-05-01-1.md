I'm recovering from a weeklong trip out of state, so it took me by surprise that #Apple just released its [Q2 financial results](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/). Not a whole lot of noteworthy items, but I was very glad to see that the iPad segment is doing quite well. Incremental growth in both units and revenue show that Apple's bifurcated strategy of issuing low-cost iPads for the masses plus high-end iPad Pros for power users has been very successful. I think at this point we can safely put all "iPad is doomed" fears to rest.
