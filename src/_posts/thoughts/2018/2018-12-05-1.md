Rewatched *Blade Runner 2049* again last night…I hadn't seen it since my first viewing in the theater (which was quite the experience). Good God I love this movie. As expected I picked up on a number of things during this subsequent viewing I hadn't before. Of most interest to me are the biblical themes…for example, Officer K at the end is a type of Jesus figure. I'll have to write more in a spoiler review some time! (Also, I enjoyed the movie soundtrack even more this time around…so-o-o good.) #scifi #movies
