I've decided (for the umpteenth time!) to resume daily microblogging. The plan is to post to my website once a day and syndicate to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaredcwhite) and [Mastodon](https://openweb.social/jared). I've really been enjoying other daily bloggers such as Seth Godin and Dave Winer for a while now, plus the folks I follow on Twitter who essentially use that platform for blogging. To aid me in this quest, I'm using Things to remind me every day at 11am Pacific to post something. We'll see how it goes. ðŸ˜ƒ
