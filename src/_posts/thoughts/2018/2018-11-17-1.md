In a recent [Essential Life video](https://jaredwhite.com/20181101/1), I proposed an essentialism challenge where you pick a top goal for focus on for a week. For myself, I picked doing some pushups every night before bed. That went pretty well, so now I've decided to continue building on that habit. For the next few weeks I'm going to try doing one more pushup each night than the night before and see how far I get. Currently I'm only up to 16 which isn't much, so hopefully I have some headroom. Maybe you'll get to see a before/after photo eventually. 💪🏻
