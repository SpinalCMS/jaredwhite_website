I don't have time to do a whole write up, so here's the gist of it: since I'm no longer using #Facebook to share family photos, I wanted to find a way to create a password-protected photo gallery. After some research, I tried out [SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com). It works great! For only a few dollars a month, I can upload and present photos far more beautifully than I ever could on social media, it's secure, and it's ad-free. Simply perfect and just in time for the holidays. Now I can email or text the link & password to family and friends, and we're off to the races. üëç
