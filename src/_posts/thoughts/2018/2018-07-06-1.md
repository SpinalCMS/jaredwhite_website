Don't forget, next week's podcast episode is all about *Share 'n' Tell* â€” specifically, I'll be sharing YOUR stories about when and how you first encountered the World-Wide Web. Just email me (jared at jaredwhite dot com) and include your first name and optionally your website, and provide a paragraph or two about what you found inspiring or amazing (or confusing!) about the web when it was first introduced to you. I'll be sharing my "origin story" as well, so it'll be quite a fun episode about the history of the #openweb!
