BELIEVE THE HYPE. I just got out of seeing *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* and it's as good as everyone's saying. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's an incredibly well-constructed movie...every little detail. A+ acting. Luscious visuals. Score was jaw-dropping. I don't often say this but I'll say it now: I give M:I-F **5 out of 5 stars**! Without a doubt one of the best #movies of 2018.
