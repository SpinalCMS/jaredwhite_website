When AR (Augmented Reality) apps and games started to become a big thing last year, I tried some of them out. Certainly made for some impressive demos, but nothing really stood out to me.  [This type of AR experience on the other hand is simpy breathtaking.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6385240964608376832) I think the combination of real-world settings with fantasy environments is a powerful combo, and a game that really gets this right might be the next big hit.
