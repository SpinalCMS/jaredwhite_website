Stan Lee has died today. 95 years old. I never got into comic books at a kid, and for whatever reason, I'm still not a consumer of that mediumâ€”however, I'm absolutely hooked on comic book-based movies and TV shows. I _love_ all the MCU movies, especially over the last four years. I love the Marvel shows on Netflix. I love Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (I also love all the "Arrowverse" DC-based shows on The CW.) So the news of Stan's passing hits me hard. What an incredible legacy of storytelling he leaves with us. #scifi #movies #tvshows
