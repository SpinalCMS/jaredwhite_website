Moving twice in just a few years has given me a great deal of perspective on what kind of relationship I want to have with _stuff_. As Millburn & Nicodemus [so rightly put it:](https://www.theminimalists.com/cost/) "the true cost of a thing goes well beyond the price on the pricetag." I applaud my wife for starting us on this journey towards getting rid of anything that doesn't "spark joy" and add value to our livesâ€”and the more we are intentional about keeping or buying only that which is truly essential, useful, and aesthetically pleasing, the more I feel an overwhelming sense of contented satisfaction. #minimalism
