I finally got around to watching the much-hyped Netflix documentary _Wild Wild Country_. Actually I binge-watched all six episodes because it was one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life. Wow! I have so many thoughts on so many levels. Might need to write a longer essay soon once I've processed it more. (Personal aside: not many people know this, but prior to getting married, both my wife and I were in religous cultsâ€¦no, not the same ones! So any time I watch a documentary about any sort of cult, it hits home hard.) #tvshows
