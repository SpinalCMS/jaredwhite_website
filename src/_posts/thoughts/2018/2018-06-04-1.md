Today's the day! #Apple is kicking off their world-wide developer conference (WWDC), and along with everyone else I'll be watching the keynote and digging into all the latest goodies that will set the tone for the next 12 months of Apple's technology vision and software strategy. I plan to record an episode of [The Jared White Show](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast) tonight to cover these announcements and more, and it will drop either tonight or first thing Tuesday morning. Exciting! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ™Œ
