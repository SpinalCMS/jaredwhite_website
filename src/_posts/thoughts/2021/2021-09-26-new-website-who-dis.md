new #website, who dis ü§ì

j/k. I'm super excited to present my _newly-redesigned_ website (still powered by #Bridgetown of course). The [previous design](early-2021-website-design.jpg) was heavily centered around a "social network" vibe, as if you were looking at my profile page. I literally repeated my name and avatar for every post, and even had an <strong>‚ù§Ô∏é Awesome</strong> button you could click.

This time however, I decided to go back to my blogging roots and come up with a concept that's both retro and forward-looking. So in terms of typography, shading, mobile navigation, performance, and other small touches, it feels like a modern website‚Ä¶but at the same time it's totally obvious that it's a <strong>blog</strong>. It's definitely my most holistic and disciplined personal website design to date. I hope you enjoy it!

P.S. One of my secondary goals in working on the new design was to create a codebase from which I could extract a Bridgetown theme for others to use. I don't have immediate plans to start on that, but it's only a matter of time‚Ä¶ (meanwhile, if you're curious, my website repo is [open to all](https://github.com/jaredcwhite/jaredwhite_website)).
