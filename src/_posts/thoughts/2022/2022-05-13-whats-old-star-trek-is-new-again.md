*Strange New Worlds* feels a bit like a reboot done right.

Before you misunderstand me, listen: I've been pretty pro-Discovery since its inception and particularly loved seasons 3 & 4. Picard Season 1 was a masterpiece in my view and one of the best seasons of any Trek show ever. (Season 2 was a disappointing step down from those highsâ€¦but that's a tale for another time.) And regarding the movies, while I didn't much care for the two J.J. Abrams films, [I thought Star Trek: Beyond was pretty freaking fantastic](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/my-top-5-scifi-films-of-2016#2-star-trek-beyond).

Yet in spite of all that, I do think we've been missing out a bit on that good ol' Trek TV formula, and apparently the producers at Paramount agree: because *Strange New Worlds* fills that void with glorious aplomb.

Anson Mount continues to impress as Captain Pike. He weaves in elements of the original "Cage" Pike, Kirk's swagger, Picard's experienced poise, Sisko's playfulness, and the endearing emotionality of later captains in Trek canon. Yet in the end he remains a fully individualized and memorable character. Mount as Pike doesn't feel like a copy of the captains we've already seen, so much as he feels like *the blueprint from which they later sprung*. Accomplishing that in a prequel series made nearly 60 years after a failed pilot might just be one of the cleverest hat tricks in show biz.

I'll refrain from commenting on the rest of the cast because honestly we haven't had enough time with them yet. I *will* say thatâ€”no offense to Zachary Quinto's acting prowessâ€”Ethan Peck is the best Spock we've seen since 80s Nimoy. He's filling immeasurably large shoes, and while his performance might not turn heads per se, it's understated and competent. And honestly, that's all I could hope for. I can believe he's Spock more than (for example) I ever believed Alden Ehrenreich was Han Solo.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied with *Strange New Worlds*. I suppose things could fall to pieces in future episodes, but if they can keep the quality up this high in episode 3 and thereafter, I will claim without reservation that this is the most made-for-Trekkies *Star Trek* we've seen since *The Orville*. **Oh snap!** ðŸ«¢
