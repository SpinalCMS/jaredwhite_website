I feel like it was a long time waiting for another Stange movie to arrive. I must reiterate that Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange is my favorite character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [Way back in 2016](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/my-top-5-scifi-films-of-2016), I wrote concerning the first _Doctor Strange_ movie that it featured "excellent characterization, stunning locations, a surprisingly top-drawer script, and a director that manages to pull off some of the most breathtaking effects visuals I have ever seen on screen…this is clearly one of Marvel’s best cinematic efforts to date." Eight years and several rewatches later, I still hold by that assessment.

So believe me when I say I've been **very, very excited** to head out to my local movie theater to see _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_. Unfortunately, while I did enjoy the experience and by no means think this is a bad film, overall my opinion is mixed on the merits of this second outing. There were aspects to the movie I thought were utterly delightful and wickedly clever. Yet there were other moments where I found myself befuddled and disappointed at the choices made by the Marvel story team. Without giving away any spoilers, I thought the tie-ins with _Wandavision_ were the weakest links in the chain by far. Elizabeth Olsen certainly pulls off an amazing acting feat in her role, but the role itself in the context of the entire story arc left me cold. I honestly wish they'd gone in a different direction and not touched her character at all. (Perhaps leave that to a "Wandavision 2" or standalone Scarlet Witch movie.)

I'll share [this **spoiler-filled** dive into the film](https://youtu.be/HEuzbTNgRLg) by one of my favorite YouTube pundits, Kristian Harloff. I think his thoughts echoed my own in nearly all cases, so if you've watched it yourself by now, you might find his commentary intriguing.

In the end, I did appreciate much of what was in the movie scene-by-scene and enjoyed my time at the theater, but the problematic elements of the story took the entire experience down a notch. Overall, I'd have to rank this in the lower half of MCU productions to date, and nowhere near my Top 10. Which is a real shame considering the first _Doctor Strange_ film is one of my favorite comic-book / #scifi #movies of all time.
