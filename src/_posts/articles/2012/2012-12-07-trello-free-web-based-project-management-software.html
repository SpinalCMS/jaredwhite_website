<p class=""><i class=""> Note: this post was originally written for another blog on October 11, 2011. I occasionally republish articles here on jRead from my archives.</i><br></p><p class=""></p><p class=""><b>I am a project management software junkie</b>. Every few months I think to myself “there’s gotta be a better tool to organize everything I’m trying to work on and figure out!” Usually I end up cobbling together a home-brewed solution based on common tools like calendars, reminder lists, note-taking, and so forth. Actually, I must say I’ve grown quite fond of Evernote, the much-hyped cloud-based notes app. But I digress.</p><p class="">What I’ve really wanted all along is a tool that combines the functionality of sticky notes, to-do lists, and comments &amp; social sharing all together in one <b class="">easy-to-use, visually compelling package</b> where I can see everything that needs my attention at a single glance.</p><p class=""><b>Enter  <a href="http://trello.com/" target="_blank" class="">Trello</a></b>. </p><p>  </p><p class="">Trello is like sticky notes reimagined for the 21st century. Esentially, Trello is a collection of boards, each board featuring any number of “lists” you want. Each list can have a multitude of cards (they literally look like cards). Each card can contain a <b>surprisingly-rich amount of structured information that you see when you click on a card</b>. For example, a card can contain:</p><p></p><ul><li>A title</li><li>A description</li><li>Comments from multiple users</li><li>One or more checklists (for tracking to-do’s)</li><li>Votes from multiple users</li><li>File attachments</li><li>Colored and named labels</li><li>A due date</li></ul><p></p><p class="">You are free to move cards around between lists or up and down on the same list for at-a-glance prioritization. As the company states, “in one glance, <b>Trello tells you what’s being worked on, who’s working on what, and where something is in a process</b>.” Using Trello becomes addictive because somehow creating cards and moving them around on screen is so much more satisfying than scrolling through an endless list of entries in a box like most software. Oh, and <b>did I mention that Trello is free?</b> Yeah, that one really blows my mind.</p><p>How you set up Trello is really up to you. You can literally create whatever workflow fits your brain and your project. I have a Trello workflow at my digital media agency that suits me and the consulting nature of my business very well. I have lists for Inactive Clients, Active Clients, Sales, Internal Product Development, Marketing, Operations, Contractors, and so forth. That way, I am able to keep track of all the people and features are make up the moving parts of my business.</p><p class="">Before Trello, I literally had sticky-notes flying around my desk or I had to pour through a linear stack of notes stored in some other software. Now with Trello, I can literally bring up the app and just <b>look around the screen for a moment to be reminded instantly what I should focus on next</b>.</p><p class="">And did I mention Trello is <b>free</b>?</p><p class=""><a href="http://trello.com/" target="_blank"> Go check Trello out today</a>.   It’s “in the cloud” so you can log in and use it on the web from anywhere. iPhone and Android apps are also available, and a native iPad app is currently in development. I await its arrival with baited breath. Fog Creek Software, it can’t come soon enough for me!</p>
