<p class="">I was listening to the recent episode of Michael Hyatt’s excellent podcast <i>This is Your Life</i>&nbsp;yesterday, and the topic was on delegation. <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/042-the-fine-art-of-delegation-part-1-podcast.html" target="_blank" class="">The fine art of delegation</a>, to be precise. This resonated with me because that’s exactly what I’m beginning to learn how to do.</p><p class="">I’ve been a “solopreneur” for quite some time now, and while I’ve often worked with clients or fellow team members on a variety of projects, I’ve rarely had the chance to delegate. In other words, I haven’t had the luxury of mapping out a sequence of tasks that need to be performed, and then deciding which ones are best suited to someone else and which ones I can handle myself. Either the tasks are being handed to me after that decision was already made, or I’m handling all the tasks after I map them out myself.</p><p class="">This year, my three-word mantra is <b>Value, Amplification, Creativity</b>. As part of living that out on a regular basis, I’m determined to get clear on where exactly I’m adding the most value to a project, and then in addition deciding who else can add value to the project in their own unique way. I may be good at a lot of things, and I may be merely OK at others, but I’m great at only a small number of things. The things I’m only OK at, I most certainly should delegate to others. The things I’m good at, well, it’s a toss-up. However, I should delegate some things I’m good at in order to focus on the things I’m truly great at. I need to learn how to say no in order to say yes to what’s truly important.</p><p class="">That’s why, for example, I recently hired on a new content developer for my media company North Bay Startup. It’s not that I can’t write, of course – after all, I have this blog! – but I want to stay focused on my design work and my podcast, and delegate the writing of startup resource guides and other educational information to someone who’s great at research as well as technical/business writing. By saying no to writing these materials myself, I can say yes to putting more effort into other aspects of the company that need my full attention.</p><p class="">What are you really good at? What really matters to you? On the other hand, what are some things you might be able to delegate? What are you only OK at, or even good at, that if it was offloaded to somebody else it would free you up to focus on the really important stuff? Ask yourself these questions, and you may be surprised to find a whole new world of possibilities opening up before you.</p><p class=""><br></p><blockquote class=""></blockquote><p class=""><i class="">Credit: Illustration by <a href="http://margarit.ralev.com/" target="_blank">Margarit.Ralev.Com</a></i></p>
