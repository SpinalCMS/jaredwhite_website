<p>Every creative person lives for the thrill of starting something completely new. A new song. A new book. A new business. A new painting. A new fashion line.</p><p class="">When you are starting something new, everything is possible. The sky’s the limit! The world is your oyster! Your only limitation is what’s between your ears.</p><p class="">But then some time passes. The work becomes problematic. The fun has been slowly zapped away by difficulties, deadlines, and delays.&nbsp;The great ideas are harder to come by. You begin to wonder what’s wrong with you. You begin to feel like you’re drowning in a sea of your own making.</p><p class="">And you then you think the thought to end all thoughts. Maybe I should start something new? Maybe it’s time to move on? Maybe this project has run its course and there are other mountains to climb. But if I go through with this, isn’t that admitting defeat? Isn’t that being a flake? Wouldn’t that prove what all those critics in my head are always saying – that I never stick with anything?</p><h3>This Is Normal.</h3><p class="">It’s taken me thirty years to realize this simple yet startling truth. This is the normal lifecycle of the creative soul. In modern business parlance, it’s called being a “serial entrepreneur” – the person who’s always dreaming up the Next Big Thing. I used to beat myself up over it. I have stacks and stacks of paper – both real and virtual – loaded with software projects, media plays, e-commerce companies, etc. I even have plans to start a restaurant, and I don’t know anything about running a restaurant.</p><p class="">Like I said, I used to beat myself up over it. Jared, you’re a flake. Jared, you need to just pick one thing and stick with it. Jared, you’ll never be successful – you’ll be like that annoying loser sidekick who’s always telling people about what he’s gonna do when he makes it to the big leagues, when he hits the jackpot, when he’s finally a success.</p><p class="">But then I discovered something that some of my favorite (and successful) creative visionaries call&nbsp;<i>permission</i>. I gave myself permission to dream, dream lots, dream big, dream often. I began to celebrate all the notes on my stacks of paper. I began to write down new ideas not with distaste but with gusto. I began to plan what kind of financial structure I’d need to put in place to capitalize on my best ideas. I started to consider what sort of team I’d want to work with to bring some of these ideas to fruition. I began to map out the best way to build a framework where I could keep leveraging small success into newer, bigger successes.</p><h3>I’m not “there” yet. But I’m well on my way.</h3><p>I don’t have all the answers. I’m still not sure I’ll reach the level of success I yearn for. But at least I’ve stopped beating myself up. I’m not poo-pooing my dreams. I’m not listening to the critics in my head. Oh, I never stick with anything? Good! You know what happens to a person when they stop trying new things, stop learning, stop imagining, stop challenging the status quo, stop searching for new opportunities?</p><p>They’re pronounced dead.</p><p>And I’m still very much alive, thank you.</p>
