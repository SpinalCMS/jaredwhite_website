<p class=""><span class="">It’s a new year! Time to go out and conquer. <b>Kill</b> that fat. <b>Terminate</b> that debt. <b>Quit</b> that lousy job. <b>Obliterate</b> all obstacles holding you back.</span></p><p class=""><span class=""><i>And then that doesn’t happen.</i></span></p><p class=""><span>And then we get depressed.</span></p><p class=""><span>And then we get on with life.</span></p><p class=""><span class="">And then the end of the year approaches once again, and we get depressed about all the stuff we didn’t do in the year.</span></p><p class=""><span class="">And then we get some time off around the holidays, catch our breath, and guess what?</span></p><p class=""><span class=""><b class="">It’s a new year!</b> Time to go out and conquer….</span></p><h3 class="">Maybe there’s a better way to do this thing.</h3><p class="">What would you do if you found out that this new year is the last year you’ll spent on Planet Earth? Morbid thought, I know, but such questions are worth the asking because it helps bring clarity and <b>focus</b> and increased awareness of <b>what matters</b>.</p><p class="">I spent some time with my Bride over the weekend mapping out some key goals we want to aim for in the year ahead. We drew 12 boxes on a whiteboard, labeled them by month, and jotted down one to three items in each.</p><p class="">But that’s not the significant point. <b>What’s more significant is what we didn’t put on the board.</b></p><p class="">I am growing more and more confortable saying <i style="font-weight: bold;">NO! </i>to things that come up in my life. These aren’t bad things, they’re good things. Good ideas. Good times. Good people. Maybe even good money.</p><p class="">But what I am beginning to realize is I don’t want to settle for good. I want to settle for <b>great</b>. Great ideas. Great times. Great people. Great money, if possible.</p><p class="">And that means I have ask myself constantly if what I’m doing is <b class="">bringing great value</b>. Value for others. Value for my family. Value for myself.</p><p class="">I don’t believe God placed me here in space and time just to slide through life and avoid scraping my elbows. I believe I’m here for a <b>reason</b> — a powerful, dangerous, influential reason.</p><p class="">Does that sound like hubris? Perhaps. But here’s something else I believe:</p><p class=""><b>You’re here for a reason.</b></p><p class="">And you can choose to slide through life, or you can choose to live a life that’s <b>powerful, dangerous, and influential. </b>Say no to some of the good stuff, so you can say <b class="">YES</b>&nbsp;to some of the great stuff.</p><p class=""><b class=""><br></b></p><p class=""><b class="">I hope you choose the latter.</b></p><p class=""><span class=""><i><br></i></span></p><p class="" style="font-size:1.2em"><span class=""><i class="">Happy New Year! Bring it on!</i></span></p>
