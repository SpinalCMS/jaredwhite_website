Once in a while, [the sensation of having a "broken brain"](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/making-the-mental-breakthrough-that-depression-is-rooted-in-fear-not-sadness) comes back to me with a vengeance. Usually there's some sort of external trigger: an event  or series of events that objectively aren't that big of a deal but in a compromised state loom large. Combine that with something physically off like poor diet or lack of sleep, and you have the perfect staging area for a major onset of anxiety and panic.

I can't control when and where this happens. I try to take preventative steps each day like ensuring I'm sleeping decent hours, eating something at regular intervals, and following a reasonable to-do list to stay focused—but life doesn't always play by the rules.

When I feel the shadows closing in on me, I've found that it's helpful to remind myself that I'm just having a "temporary brain malfunction." The key word here is _temporary_. This conveys the fact that I shouldn't put too much stock in my opinions on various matters while my emotions are on the fritz. For example, if I'm having a difficult time today working on a client project, recognizing my brain's just a little bit broken makes me realize I shouldn't get too upset with the client or with the work. It might feel frustrating now, but in a day or two I probably won't even remember what I was upset about!

In other words, it's possible to validate your feelings and embrace your emotional state—crazy though it may be—without validating the conclusions you reach as a result of those feelings. Saying "I'm upset about X" is not the same as saying "X is a terrible situation."

**The struggle is real, but the darkness is not.**

When you don't feel well, when the anxiety is near debilitating, life sucks. But give yourself permission to rest, to take a bit of time off, to regroup. Once your brain is able to put everything back into alignment, you can reevaluate your situation with fresh eyes. I suspect that, most of the time, you'll see that things are far more sunnier than you thought before.
