<p><strong>Start living your life and not somebody else’s.</strong> What exactly does that mean? Why would anyone&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;live their own life? Why would any want want to live someone else’s?</p><p class="">Ever watch&nbsp;<i>Being John Malkovich</i>?</p><p>In all seriousness, it’s far too easy to live life according to what you imagine is expected of you, or what is the “right thing” to do. (Right according to whom?)</p><p class="">Now I haven’t been on planet Earth all that long…32 years…but I&nbsp;<i>have</i>&nbsp;learned a few things along the way. I’ve observed there are a couple of key ingredients that successful individuals seem to have mastered, and I’m in the process of staying on target:</p><ol class=""><li>Learn to develop extremely focused and valuable instincts for what you want to achieve in life and how to achieve it.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Trust your instincts.</b></li></ol><p class="">Recently I spent some serious time reviewing the last 10 years of my life, and I noticed a pattern. Every time things seemed to go sideways and my plans took months (or years) to get back on track, it was because, essentially,&nbsp;<b>I lost the nerve to go after my dreams</b>.</p><p>Maybe I got distracted.</p><p>Maybe I forgot.</p><p>Maybe I let someone talk me out of them</p><p>Maybe I spent too much energy worrying about what other people might think.</p><p>Maybe I didn’t trust, at my young age, that I would make the right decisions when people twice my age apparently couldn’t understand my ambitions.</p><p><b>Whatever the reason, I didn’t follow through with my goals, and I ended up having to pick up the pieces later.</b></p><p class="">Bringing in the spiritual dimension here, I pray and seek God a lot to help me find the right dreams and the right priorities. I’m not saying be an arrogant jerk and think you have all the answers. But what I AM saying is,&nbsp;<i>if you know that you know that you know</i>&nbsp;that you need to do X, Y, and Z, then DO IT!</p><p><b>Don’t let anyone talk you out of it.</b></p><p class=""><b>Don’t let anyone make you feel like you’re not ready, or not worthy, or not whatever.</b></p><p class="">My biggest regrets in life aren’t the mistakes I’ve made trying something new, they’re the things&nbsp;<i>I never tried</i>. Figure out why you exist in this crazy world, screw your courage to the sticking place (as Shakespeare would say), and go kick ass.</p><blockquote class="">Quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death. Set God-sized goals. Pursue God-ordained passions. Go after a dream that is destined to fail without divine intervention. Keep asking questions. Keep making mistakes. Keep seeking God.<br/><br/>Don’t try to be who you’re not. Be yourself. Laugh at yourself. Don’t let fear dictate your decisions. Take a flying leap of faith.&nbsp;<b>Chase the lion!</b><br/><br/>–<i>Mark Batterson</i></blockquote>
