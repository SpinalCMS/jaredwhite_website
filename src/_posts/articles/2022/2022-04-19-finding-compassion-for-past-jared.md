There is no photo of myself I hate more than the one below (taken in the Fall of 2014). If I were captured by an Evil Mastermind, they could force me to divulge all my deepest darkest secrets by threatening to release this photo to my friends and loved ones. (**But HAHA HA, the joke's on you Evil Mastermind!** I've preemptively published this for the whole world to see! _Bwha ha ha!_ Ha. Ha?)

<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/jared-dweeb.jpg" alt="a selfie where I look not great" style="width:380px; border-radius:4px"><figcaption style="opacity:0.6">(a cry for help)</figcaption></figure>

Oh boy, where do we start‚Ä¶that abysmal haircut, ugly-ass shirt, weird glasses, nice-guy-but-also-maybe-serial-killer half-smile, missing facial hair, bad upper lip skin visible for all to see‚Ä¶I look like a corporate office drone who's been forced to process TPS reports in a windowless room all day and has _finally_ been released to volunteer for the church social this afternoon. (Um‚Ä¶guess where this photo was taken? ü§ì)

### What Was Really Going On

My wife at the time was **extremely pregnant**‚Ä¶the birth of our second child was mere days away. I didn‚Äôt fully realize it at the time but I was suffering from chronic depression. There had been a major dustup at a startup I‚Äôd been consulting for, and I was suddenly _persona non grata_. In fact things there would reach a boiling point **during my parental leave**. (Ouch.) Not to mention only a few months prior to this we had moved to an entirely different town _and_ rented out our old house simultaneously! (‚Ä¶which ended up an epic disaster, but that‚Äôs a tale for another time.) **I was exhausted.** And that was _before_ the arrival of a newborn!

In other words, I look awful in this picture because I subconsciously _felt_ awful. **It was an exceedingly challenging time in my life on every front.** In fact, most of the worst things which ever happened to me took place during 2010-2015. So in 2014, I was still right in the thick of it. 

However, little did I know in that particular moment that **a surprising series of events would soon transpire**, setting into motion huge life changes which eventually resulted in me starting a totally new and far more successful [consulting business](https://www.whitefusion.studio), [resettling in Portland](/articles/what-its-like-to-live-in-portlandia), [going through a divorce](/articles/hello-singleness-my-old-friend) (shockingly painful but absolutely necessary), [reimagining my whole spiritual outlook on life](/articles/ice-cream), and **producing the [best art](/projects) of my entire career**.

### The Joy of New Identities

Originally this essay was supposed to be an indictment of my past self and a _hip-hip-hurrah_ statement on why I‚Äôm so keen to reinvent myself even now. However, upon further reflection, I realized how grateful I should be to my past self(ves), and how I should really offer **Office-Space-in-2014-Jared** nothing but grace. **Because** if I hadn‚Äôt starting taking control over my life _then_ and finding a more authentic purpose which was unabashedly **me**, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today.

So instead of feeling chagrin or anger as I reflect upon who I used to be, **I can instead find joy.** The joy of forging a new identity, brick by brick, layer by layer. Making some mistakes along the way, sure‚Ä¶but mostly achieving some **big wins**. It‚Äôs a never-ending process. Even though I generally feel much happier and more at ease with who I am today, I suspect I‚Äôll be even more ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù in the future. I‚Äôll look back on this time with a good-natured eye-roll and a toothy grin. _Oh the things I didn‚Äôt even know that I didn‚Äôt know!_

I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

**Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,**  
**But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.**
