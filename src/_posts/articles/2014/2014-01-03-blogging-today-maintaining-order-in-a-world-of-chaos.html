<p class="">The stuggle with blogging in today’s climate isn’t just finding an audience or figuring out what to write about. It’s figuring out what <i>not </i>to write about.</p>
<p class="">Media overload works both ways. It pulls a blog’s potential readership in a zillion different directions, but it also pulls a blog author in a zillion different directions. We’re on Facebook, same as everyone. We’re on Twitter, same as everyone. We’re on Pinterest, LinkedIn, App.net, Instagram, Buzzfeed, Upworthy, Snarfblat, and Dinglehopper. (OK, I made those last two services up.)</p>

<h3 class="">What’s needed is some good, ol’ fashioned intervention: a schedule.</h3>
<p class="">A blogging schedule can take a myriad of forms, but its purpose is twofold:</p>
<p class=""></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="">Keep your scope of potential blog topics focused, repeatable, and consistent.</li>
<li class="">Keep your frequency of posting from being determined by emotional state, energy level, or likelihood for distraction.</li>
</ul>
<p class="">The goal of the schedule is less about “business objectives” – although if you plan to go pro and make money from your blog, that could be a consideration – and more about keeping yourself honest. It should channel your attention every day towards what your readership is expecting from you. In blogging, both <i>quality</i> and <i>quantity</i> are equal partners.</p>
<p class="">This year, I’m experimenting with a blogging schedule that maps out a variety of topics I’m passionate about, and that also targets the right audience of a specific demographic. I’m pre-writing a number of headlines and placing them onto the schedule at specific intervals, and I’m even selecting images &amp; photos which will accompany each post to reinforce its editorial slant. I’m using some free online software to help me accomplish this which I will detail in a future blog post.</p>
<p class="">With schedule in hand, I’m feeling excited and confident that this year will be my best blogging year ever. Well, at the very least, it will be my most organized!</p>

<p class="touch-active">How about you? Are you a blogger? If so, do you have a schedule mapped out this year? I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
