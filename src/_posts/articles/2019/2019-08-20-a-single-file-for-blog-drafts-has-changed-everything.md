I'm going to get meta for a moment and talk to you about blogging.

I've hardly written any articles for my blog this year. I had my reasons. I hit the ground running with video and podcast content, I moved to Portland proper and opened up a multimedia production studio (a setup still very-much-in-progress), my web design business has been on a tear and I need those extra hours to pay for said studio, and the list goes on.

**But now things are turning around, and I've started on a new practice which has changed everything for me.**

I designated a single file in [1Writer](http://1writerapp.com) (my Markdown editor of choice…although I also like Bear and Ulysses) to be used for writing blog drafts. I used to jot down ideas in whatever note or task app was in vogue at the time (Evernote, Trello, Apple Notes, etc.), but then I'd just end up with a random bunch of headlines and not much else. Then for a while I tried having articles in individual files in my writing app. The problem there was I felt pressured to really write out the whole post one at a time. Once you get that new file going with a headline and a paragraph, you just can't help yourself.

### What I *really* needed was a scratchpad.

I needed a centralized place just to "vomit" out all my thoughts in rapid succession. (Doesn't that sound appetizing!) Then later on when the time comes to post something legit, it's just a matter of selecting a wad of text and copy-pasting it into a real article file.

I suppose what I'm driving at is essentially the digital equivalent of carrying a little journal/notebook around with me. But I'm _allergic to paper_, so I much prefer to use my iPad to manage my writing process. Having a single "Quick Drafts" file is the best solution for this need.

A few weekends ago, I took a trip to the ocean. At a hip coffee shop near the beach, I spent about 30 minutes typing away and ended up with *five* draft posts waiting for further exposition (not including this one). Such creative volume is unprecedented!

I'm now taking one of those drafts and polishing it up into this article. I simply can't wait to dive back in and add a few more drafts. If you need to jumpstart your writing habit again, this just might do the trick.
