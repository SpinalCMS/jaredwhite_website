My alter ego as a producer of synthwave, chillout, and thematic electronica. Yarred was a lover of 80â€™s classic synthpop & electronic music long before it was cool. Nice to see the world catching up. ðŸ˜Ž

As a modern purveyor of retro-flavored electronica, Yarred is equally comfortable on stage or in the studio.  Yarred combines cutting-edge DJ-style live groove production with classic keyboard playing on analog and digital synthesizers.

Don't miss listening to _Multnomah_, the follow-up sequel album to _Redwood Coast_, which doubles down even more on Yarredâ€™s powerful signature sound. And stay tuned for a late 2021/early 2022 release of a major collaboration effort with world-renowned synthesist Paul Ellis.
