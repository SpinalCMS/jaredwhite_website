My alter ego as a producer of synthwave, chillout, and thematic electronica. Yarred was a lover of 80â€™s classic synthpop & electronic music long before it was cool. Nice to see the world catching up. ðŸ˜Ž

As a modern purveyor of retro-flavored electronica, Yarred combines cutting-edge modern groove production with classic keyboard playing on analog and digital synthesizers.

Don't miss listening to _Multnomah_, the follow-up sequel album to _Redwood Coast_, which doubles down even more on Yarredâ€™s powerful signature sound. And be sure to check out _Unbroken Spirit_, Yarred's latest release in collaboration with world-renowned synthesist and space musician Paul Ellis.
