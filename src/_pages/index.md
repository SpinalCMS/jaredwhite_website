## Hello and Welcome! <sl-icon library="remixicon" name="{{ "destinations.home.icon" | t }}"></sl-icon>

I’m Jared, _an award-winning_ essayist, **Rubyist**, and podcaster who’s been commenting on and building for the web since Mosaic was a thing. (Yup, it’s true! 😆)

In my spare time I travel around Portland and the Pacific Northwest (pandemic lockdowns notwithstanding) and make artsy-fartsy videos. 📹 📺

This is my home on the internet. I hope you enjoy browsing around! 📍

**P.S. What am I doing now? [That's what the Now Page is for!](/now)** ⏱
