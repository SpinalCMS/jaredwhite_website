I was contemplating what I should write about for this issue, and after not settling on anything compelling, I decided to write about every writer's favorite topic: **writing.**

Seriously, go Google (or DuckDuckGo if you prefer) "famous writer quotes" and the first entries which show up are quotes by famous authors on the art of writing. Here are a few choice selections:

<div class="quote" markdown="1">
Most writers regard the truth as their most valuable possession, and therefore are most economical in its use.  
â€“ _Mark Twain_
</div>

<div class="quote" markdown="1">
Itâ€™s none of their business that you have to learn to write. Let them think you were born that way.  
â€“ _Ernest Hemingway_
</div>

<div class="quote" markdown="1">
I try to create sympathy for my characters, then turn the monsters loose.  
â€“ _Stephen King_
</div>

<div class="quote" markdown="1">
And as imagination bodies forth  
The forms of things unknown, the poetâ€™s pen  
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing  
A local habitation and a name.  
â€“ _William Shakespeare_
</div>

Ah, good old Shakespeare. Next time when somebody asks me what my favorite pastime is, I'll just tell them I turn the forms of things unknown into shapes and give to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.

_Come again?_

Speaking of authors, I've been listening to recent episodes of [The Robcast]( https://robbell.com/portfolio/robcast/) by Rob Bell where he's been reading excerpts from his own books. The first thing I realized during these auditory forays is _Damn, I need to read more Rob Bell books!_ The second thing I realized is the reason he cites for why he writes is exactly why I love to write. Like Bell, I love to write because it helps me process through what I'm going through. Feelings, questions, ideas, frustrations, hopes and dreams, visions for the futureâ€¦all that energy swirling around the synaptic network of my cranium becomes full-fledged concepts and opinions and statements when I'm able to put pen to paper (or rather, finger to keyboard).

O, I need to write more. Something in my soul begins to corrode if I don't get those author juices flowing. But it's hard to find the time without sacrificing other important endeavors such asâ€¦**The Jared White Show**. (There's a transition fer ya.)

**[ðŸŽ™ Episode 29: What Instagram Gets Right](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/29/)**

In this episode I go on a deep dive into the greatest aspects of Instagram and what alternative services will need to build in order to provide compelling experiences. I also ponder on the notion that 2019 might be shaping up to be The Year of the iPad Pro. Will iOS 13 push the envelope of whatâ€™s possible in iPad software? (All signs point YES!)

There's also a Pasta PC if you're interested. Yes, you heard me right. Pasta. PC.

I'll close this out with one more quote:

<div class="quote" markdown="1">
Do not shirk thy civic duty by forgoing a singular episode of Ye Olde Jared White Show.  
â€“ _George Washington_
</div>

You can't argue with George Washington.
