Have you heard about the game folks on Twitter are playing called "whamageddon"? You have to try to get through your whole day without hearing *Last Christmas* by English pop duo Wham! (hence the name of the game). So far, I'm really seem to be winning at this.

Oh, scratching your head, eh? Well considering how batshit crazy this year has been, if that's the extent of the holiday shenanigans we must endure before 2020 hits, I'm down.

So here's to the end of a decade and the beginning of a new one (no, I'm not getting into a debate over if 2020 is actually the end of the decade). I, for one, am quite ready for a clean slate.

Cheers!
