  footage, so I'm chomping at the bit to compile that all into an episode for next

Most weeks, I just don't feel very productive as a content creator. I'm always obsessing over how I could have done more, imagined more, produced more, written more, edited more, published more.

Not this week. ðŸ¤£

Let's start with the video. On Monday, I published an intimate **Essential Life** vlog episode shot in my studio/kitchen (they're part of the same large room).

And finally, on Thursday (yesterday), over at **Simple Praxis** I published a detailed autobiographical essay of my journey out of religious fundamentalism, joining the ranks of the #Exvangelical movement. I've read so many stories by others with gut-wrenching tales far more shocking than mine, but my story is certainly not without its moments of the macabre or bizarre. I hope you at least find it somewhat entertainingâ€¦
