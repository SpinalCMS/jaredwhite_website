*Third time's a charm?*

Twice before November 9th, I had visited downtown Seattle with camera in hand hoping to shoot a meaty vlog episode, only to get back to the studio and realize the footage just fell flat. If you've ever returned from a photo or video shoot and felt that sinking sensation that all the work you put into it still didn't result in the level of quality you were anticipating, you know just what I mean.

But undeterred, our intrepid hero made the trek north once again, and this time, **this time**â€¦it worked. In fact, not only did I manage to publish one vlog epidode, I published TWO! 
ðŸ™Œ  (Links to both belowâ€¦)

But enough about me. The real news (in geekville, anyway) over the past week has been the much-awaited launch of Apple's new **16" MacBook Pro with Magic Keyboard**. If you've at all been following the outrageously long and frustrating saga of the "butterfly" keyboards featured in Apple's notebook lineup since 2016, no doubt you are breathing a HUGE sigh of relief that we *finally* have a new keyboard in the mix (one that I expect will replace all lingering butterfly keyboards soon enough). Early reports suggest this new keyboard is just as awesome and durable as the desktop Magic Keyboard beloved by many, and I sincerely hope it's time we put the bad ol' days of Apple laptop wonkiness behind us for good.
