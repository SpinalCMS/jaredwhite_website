On my [Now Page](https://jaredwhite.com/now/) which I last updated on January 1, I wrote "still not blogging regularly on JaredWhite.com, still not sending out weekly email newsletters. 😭 I think I need a 'series' idea or something because otherwise it’s just not gonna happen…"

As we bid farewall to January and welcome the arrival of February (already?? time's moving so fast my head is spinning…), I finally—FINALLY—have that series idea squarely in my sights. And it is called (drumroll please 🥁):

**Tales from Decrypt: Stories of Woe and Wonder from My 25-Year Career as a Freelance Web Developer**

The first installment is linked below. I think it came out pretty well, what do you think?

Also worthy of mentioning is my newest **Fresh Fusion** podcast episode: [blusky’s Smiling at Me](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/63/). It's all about the the vital necessity of competence in leadership and governance, life imitating art imitating life, and a megadose of fascinating news regarding Twitter’s forays into decentralization and open moderation tools.

Enjoy! ✌️
