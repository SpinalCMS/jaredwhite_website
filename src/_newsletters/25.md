I hate making excuses. I think to myself: _nobody wants to hear about the reasons why you didn't post something._ It's like that old adage in the movies‚Ä¶show, don't tell. Instead of talking about why you didn't post stuff, **post some damn stuff!**

But if I'm being honest and switch my lizzard brain off for a moment, I actually _enjoy_ reading or hearing about other people's lives. If they've been going through the ringer and it's had an impact on their art or business or whathaveyou, I eat that stuff up.

So here's me, giving you a tasty little morsel to eat up. **Spoiler alert:** I moved! No, not away from Portland, but rather **to** Portland in an even more substantial way.

Confused yet? [**Just read the article already**‚Ä¶and you'll never believe what happens next!](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/oh-that-kind-of-new-year) üòú

Seriously though, **a major sequence of events went down** in late March, and I'm just coming up for air now to the point where I can start to get back into the swing of things regarding this newsletter, the podcast, etc. It'll still be touch and go for a bit, but I'm definitely on the upswing once again. My article explains some of the reasons why.

I apologize if you were eagerly waiting for my podcast episode all about Apple's March 25 event. It was an intriguing event to be sure, and I really enjoyed it. But pretty much every other podcaster on the planet has covered the news _to death_ by now, so I probably will have to move on (except for specific tidbits that come up). I do comment a bit on Apple News+ below, now that I've had a chance to use it.

I'll leave you with a quote I'm particularly fond of:
