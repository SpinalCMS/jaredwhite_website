Well now…

**This** is something I've never done before!

My video show “Essential Life with Jared” and my podcast “The Jared White Show” have joined forces to bring you a special video edition of the podcast.

[![Watch the video!](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/790866387.jpg?mw=1920&mh=1080&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/342068054)

Also on the show, why am I now using Vimeo instead of YouTube? The quick answer is:

OWN YOUR OWN PLATFORM.

(Long answer: I like paying for ad-free hosting services built specifically to cater to creators. That's not what YouTube is.)

Anyway, whether you consume the [audio podcast](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/34) or [video format of the show](https://vimeo.com/342068054), I hope you enjoy it! Just hit reply on this email and let me know what you think. =)
