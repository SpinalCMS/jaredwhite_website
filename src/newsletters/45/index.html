        <h3>Issue #45: Like a Professional</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="content center-block">

        <div class="copy">
          <p>I recently returned from a train trip up to Seattle. (I‚Äôve been wanting to try the Amtrak Cascades line ever since moving within walking distance of Portland‚Äôs Union Station!)</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs all going to get covered in my next vlog episode. Today, however, I‚Äôm here to ruminate on the release of the 50th‚Äîyes, <em>FIF-tee-ITH</em> episode of <strong>The Jared White Show</strong>.</p>

<p>When I originally thought about starting YAPWIPORTEOATFO (Yet Another Podcast Which I‚Äôll Probably Only Record Ten Episodes Of And Then Fizzle Out), I hesitated for quite a long time and not just because I was wary of starting something new that doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. <strong>I was mostly afraid of simply being‚Ä¶boring.</strong> Most podcasts I listen to involve multiple people: an interviewer and an interviewee, or two buddies chatting over a pint, or a panel discussion, or whatever. It‚Äôs a conversation, and you as the listener get to insert yourself silently into the mix.</p>

<p>But I didn‚Äôt have a buddy or panel to do a podcast with. It was just me and a microphone. And the choice was simply this: either record a show and <em>possibly</em> watch it fail, or don‚Äôt bother trying at all. <strong>Which option is more rewarding in the end?</strong></p>

<p>So I. Went. For. It. And here we are, 50 episodes later, and I‚Äôm <em>so-o-o-o</em> glad I did. <strong>It‚Äôs been hard work, sure, but it‚Äôs also been oodles of fun.</strong> It has become a mainstay of my weekly schedule. It has grown into the centerpiece of the content I post on jaredwhite.com. And as soon as I finish with an episode, I‚Äôm already imagining what I‚Äôll record next.</p>

<p>Is it an overwhelming success? Frankly, no. The listenership is small and growth steady. But that‚Äôs why, in the episode, I talked about what keeps me motivated to stick with it and keep going with the show. Personally, I‚Äôve been a part of too many fandoms that ended abruptly before their time. <strong>I‚Äôm determined to do things differently with The Jared White Show.</strong> That day nearly two years ago, when I finally made the initial desicion to start this podcast, I swore to myself I would record <em>at least</em> 100 episodes. At that point, it will have become clear to me whether I should keep going past that or perhaps use my 100-episode-milestone to shop around for a podcast network or similar opportunity.</p>

<p>In either case, this is no longer ‚Äújust‚Äù a hobby or ‚Äújust‚Äù a side-project for me. I‚Äôm treating this as a real gig, even if any financial reward has yet to materialize. <strong>I‚Äôm taking my craft seriously, like a professional.</strong> And I believe that‚Äôs what makes it get better and better, both for me as the ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù and you as the audience.</p>

<p>As a fun little bonus to celebrate the 50th ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù of the podcast, I recorded the episode in video form as well as audio! So you can either listen to it or watch it on YouTube. Have at it.</p>
