        <h3>Issue #34: Start Climbing Mountains</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="content center-block">

        <div class="copy">
          <p>It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to discover new hobbies or pastimes later in life. (Considering I‚Äôm not quite out of my 30s yet, I‚Äôm not sure I even qualify yet for anything labeled ‚Äúlater in life.‚Äù)</p>

<p>But I definitely recognize the fact that after you‚Äôve been an adult for quite a while, your habits and patterns and inclinations tend to solidify, and it becomes very easy to keep mindlessly doing what you‚Äôve always done. For me, that means I could easily just keep writing software at a computer desk and taking a break to walk over to a coffee shop now and then. Maybe on the weekends I take the kids to the zoo.</p>

<p>Boom, there‚Äôs my life in a nutshell.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot this year about how much I want to try doing something truly new. Something unfamiliar and very different from my normal routine. <em>A challenge.</em></p>

<p>Typical athletic pursuits like going to the gym or playing tennis or riding a bike or training for a marathon sound quite boring to me. I know tons of people derive great pleasure from sports, but that‚Äôs never been my jam. However, I do love being outdoors and deeply enjoy walking in gorgeous nature settings. Always have.</p>

<p>Last month, that love of nature led me to climb a thousand feet above Timberline Lodge on the upper slopes of Mt. Hood, and that‚Äôs when I realized my newfound passion.</p>

<p><strong>I desperately want to be a mountain climber.</strong></p>

<p>Now let me quickly clarify this by saying I‚Äôm not looking to go batshit crazy and fly around the world so I can scale the heights of Mt. Everest in the middle of winter with nothing but a yak to keep me company.</p>

<p>Somewhere between ‚Äúcasual day hike through a meadow‚Äù and ‚Äútriggering an avalache that will bury me alive in a glacier at 20,000 feet‚Äù is the sweet spot of challenge and reward, effort and fun. Give myself an epic workout, reach the pinnacle of some jaw-dropping landscape, take the obligatory ‚ÄúI made it to the top!‚Äù Instagram shot, and that‚Äôs another one for the books.</p>

<p>Something about large mountains (and, apparently, volcanos in particular) literally takes my breath away. Every time I drive around the Portland area and suddenly Mt. Hood or another mountain in the Cascades becomes visible, I let out audible gasps and shrieks of sheer amazement. Every. Damn. Time.</p>

<p>And so, instead of simply being a spectator, why not embrace the mountain? Learn a few of its secrets. Become ‚Äúone‚Äù with it in some goofy mystical makes-for-a-great-Instagram-caption way. I can think of worse ways to lower my cholesterol and tick all the BMI boxes as I head into my 40s‚Ä¶plus my YouTube channel is going to be siiiiiick.</p>

<p>Just don‚Äôt shake my hand and shout <em>Break a leg!</em> In this context, I‚Äôm highly skeptical that will bring me good luck‚Ä¶</p>

<p>üòú</p>

<p>Not even trypophobia could keep me from discussing what‚Äôs new with iPhone 11, Watch Series 5, and the rest of Apple‚Äôs September extravaganza. Also my thoughts on the landmark California ruling which reclassifies Uber drivers (and other ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù workers) as employees.</p>

              Ooo boy‚Ä¶. On a whim, I tried watching _A Simple Favor_ starring Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick (streaming on Prime or Hulu), and man, that ending really and truly sucked. But more than that, it only served to underscore just how shockingly good _Barry_ is (HBO series).

Both are dark comedies with thriller elements, but every episode of _Barry_ feels like a work of art. _A Simple Favor_ is nothing more than a botched popcorn flick.

To Bill Hader, Sarah Goldberg, and Alec Berg, I say: well done! The quality of your work puts many high-profile Hollywood films to shame.

All the places a car can't go make the Pearl District a joy to walk. I'm always on the lookout for those hidden paths and courtyards when out for a stroll.

I can't believe I captured this image. It looks like something straight out of a travel brochure.

Really, the credit goes to Silver Falls State Park though‚Äîone of the most beautiful places I've visited yet in Oregon. I can't wait to go back in the spring when the volume of water going over the falls will no doubt be much greater!
