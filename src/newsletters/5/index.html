It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's a podcast! Coming soon to a player near you, _The Jared White Show_ is a curated celebration of the artform that is the web; a weekly perspective on how individuals have the power to spark open and free communication and innovation online. Stay tuned for the first episode release date!
            
            <hr />
          
            
              I'm still processing how I feel about the adrenaline-infused spectacle that is _Avengers: Infinity War_. Without giving away any spoilers, the film starts off at 100 MPH and barely lets up the gas over the next 2 hours and 36 minutes. Now this isn't all that shocking given the way action movies get made these days, but in this case it really does feel quite intense. I think it's because this truly is the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films. We've grown to love these characters who have been presented and developed in so many interesting and creative ways throughout the 18 stories that preceded Infinity War. Seeing what they go through in this massive film and what they're up against in Thanos, a villain of surprising nuance and emotional depth, is the ride of a lifetime.

While I am a huge Star Wars fan through and through, I must admit that, as a millennial, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is today's top-tier franchise that I've most bonded with. Star Wars is awesome but it's a story that came out of my parents' generation. The MCU is _my_ story. (Yes, I know most of the actual characters and some of the plot lines are from comic books that originated decades ago. But to me, having never read the comics, everything feels new and fresh.)

I'll just say one more thing about the movie (which isn't a spoiler, I promise): I was so happy with what they did with Doctor Strange in this story. Not only did he get a fair amount of screen time, he played a pivotal role on several occasions in progressing the plot forward. Benedict Cumberbatch is in top form (when is he ever not?!), and since Doctor Strange is my favorite character in the MCU (and his origin story film one of my favorite movies of all time), I was quite pleased about this.

If you haven't seen _Avengers: Infinity War_ yet, what are you waiting for? Go! Go now! It's an historical event in film history we're all going to be talking about for a long time to come. <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/movies" class="hashtag">#movies</a> <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/scifi" class="hashtag">#scifi</a>

<h2>Parents: You're Not Going to Break Your Kids</h2>

<p>When we have difficulties helping our children learn new skills or cope with the tumult of everyday life, it's tempting to want to blame ourselves. But we can choose to see the learning opportunity inherent in every emotional moment.</p>

<div class="button">

  <h2><cite><a href="https://work.qz.com/1267108/githubs-refurbished-san-francisco-headquarters-is-designed-for-inclusivity/" target="_blank">GitHub offices redesigned</a></cite></h2>

  <p>Rapt Studio’s architects jettisoned the space’s man-cave décor and replaced it with an eclectic mix of modern furniture. In lieu of the trendy shipping-container cubicles that had been there since 2015, there are now cozy spaces designed like residential living rooms. They’ve also built a room for nursing mothers, a prayer room, and gender-inclusive bathrooms. In the library, there are even sculptures of female trailblazers in computing. While GitHub’s workforce is still predominantly male, the redesign reflects CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath’s ambition to foster a more inclusive workforce.</p>

</div>

My god, the ergonomics of these newly designed spaces look absolutely terrible. We've known for decades now that having a small screen and keyboard on a table where you have to crane your neck down all the time (aka how most people use laptops in open offices and cafés) promotes a horrible posture and will cause major structural problems over time. Those weird bed/pod things litterly make my spine hurt just looking at them.

Where the hell can you just sit at a desk, look at a big screen directly in front of you (let's say an nice Retina iMac), have a decent keyboard try at elbow level, and use a chair that allows for proper setup of lumbar support, arm rests, mesh back for muscle cooling, etc.? I would _never_ work full-time in a place like this. Never.

[Here's a basic article on correct posture sitting at a computer workstation — this is not rocket science folks!](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-an-ergonomic-workstation/)

  <h2><cite><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-02/i-m-sorry-i-criticized-you-apple-you-win?cmpId=flipboard" target="_blank">I’m Sorry I Criticized You, Apple. You Win</a></cite></h2>

  <p>This is a time when an entire driverless car industry is trying to convince the world that its products are safe before it can even come up with convincing stats — or prevent deadly accidents like the one in Tempe, Arizona, earlier this year. This is a time when Google is trying to subvert new privacy regulations to turn them against content producers. A time when Facebook, blasted by media and regulators for ignoring people’s privacy concerns, starts a dating service which will collect people’s most intimate data.</p>

<p>This is a time when companies whose innovations are more intrusive than useful, more gimmicky than problem-solving, operate with business models that either burn investors’ cash or turn the users into products.</p>

<p>At a time like this, Apple is a rock of common sense, sobriety, dignified engineering supremacy, prudent financial and supply chain management, effective marketing, and customer-oriented retailing. It’s a traditional business that does most things well, demands a high price for it, and receives that high price. With Apple, what you see is largely what you get, and when it’s not, the company will not just apologize but offer a fix.</p>

</div>

While I think Leonid Bershidsky is overblowing the "boring maturity" angle here, there's a valid point to be made. <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/Apple" class="hashtag">#Apple</a> is taking its role of being a primary purveyor of computing devices and online services seriously, and is doing its utmost to design products that provide top-of-the-line performance, usability, security, and <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/privacy" class="hashtag">#privacy</a> — which is what users actually want. So much of what many other tech companies put their efforts into is not what users want...it's what those companies and their investors want. It's definitely time we as consumers stopped accepting whatever it is that Silicon Valley hands to us, and maintain a more critical eye towards whatever the Next Big Thing is that somebody's peddling.

            <p>P. S. If there’s a particular topic or question you’d like me to cover on the new podcast, just reply to this email and let me know. Over time I hope to develop the show to incorporate much more conversation between myself and readers. All right, that’s it for today’s newsletter. Have a great week!</p>
