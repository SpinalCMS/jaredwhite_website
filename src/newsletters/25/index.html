        <h3>Issue #25: Oh THAT kind of new year</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="content center-block">

        <div class="copy">
          <p>I hate making excuses. I think to myself: <em>nobody wants to hear about the reasons why you didn’t post something.</em> It’s like that old adage in the movies…show, don’t tell. Instead of talking about why you didn’t post stuff, <strong>post some damn stuff!</strong></p>

<p>But if I’m being honest and switch my lizzard brain off for a moment, I actually <em>enjoy</em> reading or hearing about other people’s lives. If they’ve been going through the ringer and it’s had an impact on their art or business or whathaveyou, I eat that stuff up.</p>

<p>So here’s me, giving you a tasty little morsel to eat up. <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> I moved! No, not away from Portland, but rather <strong>to</strong> Portland in an even more substantial way.</p>

<p>Confused yet? <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/oh-that-kind-of-new-year"><strong>Just read the article already</strong>…and you’ll never believe what happens next!</a> 😜</p>

<p>Seriously though, <strong>a major sequence of events went down</strong> in late March, and I’m just coming up for air now to the point where I can start to get back into the swing of things regarding this newsletter, the podcast, etc. It’ll still be touch and go for a bit, but I’m definitely on the upswing once again. My article explains some of the reasons why.</p>

<p>I apologize if you were eagerly waiting for my podcast episode all about Apple’s March 25 event. It was an intriguing event to be sure, and I really enjoyed it. But pretty much every other podcaster on the planet has covered the news <em>to death</em> by now, so I probably will have to move on (except for specific tidbits that come up). I do comment a bit on Apple News+ below, now that I’ve had a chance to use it.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with a quote I’m particularly fond of:</p>

<p><strong>I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.</strong> <em>Jimmy Dean</em></p>

  <h2><cite><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2019/03/27/apple-news-im-liking-it/" target="_blank">Apple News+: I’m liking it</a></cite></h2>

  <p>My initial thought was that I stopped reading magazines years ago and that I wouldn’t read digital magazines. Strangely, that part is still right for me. If Apple News+ was a collection of magazines that I could download and read, I probably wouldn’t bother with it beyond the free trial….And this is where Apple News+ surprised me a bit.</p>

<p>The main page of Apple News+ is set up just like the free version of Apple News is on the iPhone. There is a collection of stories in a variety of topic areas that you can choose to read.</p>

<p>As I began reading, I noticed that very few of the stories were from the same magazine. Instead, I was reading stories that interested me, not magazines that interested me. That’s a huge distinction.</p>

Jim Dalrymple gets it. Leading up to the <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/Apple" class="hashtag">#Apple</a> event and even afterwards, I noticed a lot of eye-rolling online about how this was just _Newsstand_ all over again and how this would be a failure just as Apple's past forays into the digital magazine space were.

But News+ is a **totally different model** compared to the previous "each-publication-is-an-app" approach. News+ is one app. No matter which magazine or newspaper you're currently reading, you are using only one app with a consistent and unified reading experience.

And perhaps most importantly, you don't have to manage a ton of different subscriptions to various publications…which adds the congitive overhead of trying to pick and choose which ones to subscribe to or not to maintain a sensible cash flow. With Apple News+, you have one subscription. That's it. One charge per month and you have access to everything.

I've been surprised how much I'm using Apple News+…on my iPhone. Of course it's a delightful reading experience on the iPad with its big beautiful display, but it works astonishingly well on iPhone. Apple even kicked off its News+ presentation showing the app running on an iPhone. That's impressive.

I'm definitely paying for News+ past the trial period, and I'm excited to see how the service grows and evolves down the road.

Tanner Springs: one of my favorite spots in the Pearl. A delight no matter what the season!

            <p>It’s been wet here on the west coast of the U.S., but I’m hoping April showers bring many May flowers. Once the sun comes back, I’m looking forward to a lot of outdoor recreation. What are you planning this spring?</p>

<p>Peace! ✌️ -J</p>
