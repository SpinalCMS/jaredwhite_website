I posted this photo on Reddit a couple of days ago, and shortly thereafter someone pointed out that it contained a hidden Peace symbol. Then another commentor noted that it was a *left-wing* Peace symbol at that. I love Reddit. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

              When AR (Augmented Reality) apps and games started to become a big thing last year, I tried some of them out. Certainly made for some impressive demos, but nothing really stood out to me.  [This type of AR experience on the other hand is simpy breathtaking.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6385240964608376832) I think the combination of real-world settings with fantasy environments is a powerful combo, and a game that really gets this right might be the next big hit.

              A lot of people are [commenting on recent statements](https://512pixels.net/2018/04/tim-cook-on-merging-device-lines/) made by <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/Apple" class="hashtag">#Apple</a> CEO Tim Cook about the future of its two major platforms. I'll be honest with you‚ÄîI don't think Cook is saying anything here that we don't already know. While it's a popular point of speculation that somehow <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/iOS" class="hashtag">#iOS</a> and <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/macOS" class="hashtag">#macOS</a> are going to be "merged" and eventually we'll all just be using a unified range of Apple computers/devices from phones to large desktops, the fact is that nothing Apple is currently doing that we can directly observe and report on is trending in that direction.

I do think that once <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/WWDC" class="hashtag">#WWDC</a> rolls around again this June, we'll hear a lot about new tools and techniques that make it easier to develop cross-platform apps that run on both iOS and macOS without a lot of fuss. But that doesn't mean the environments are merging. It just means the developer story is being simplified. And that excites me because if more iOS developers can easily port their most popular apps over to the Mac platform, that's a big win for everybody.

              Well if I had to pick any day to be sick with a cold, today's a pretty good choice...it's by far the warmest and sunniest day we've had up here in ages! I guess springtime in Oregon takes a while to rev up. üòâüåûüå≤üåøüå∫

I had the opportunity to take my family on a tour of the U.S.S. Portland, docked here in its namesake city for a formal commissioning. A fine <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/ship" class="hashtag">#ship</a> it is! We got to meet some of the crew and see quite a few areas in nearly all decks. Also enjoyed the lovely weather after nearly a week of rain! <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/portland" class="hashtag">#portland</a>

  <h2><cite><a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/bosch-review-season-4-amazon-1201952692/" target="_blank">Review: Season 4 of Amazon‚Äôs Unstoppable Cop Drama ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù</a></cite></h2>

  <p>In its fourth season, ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù remains as good and solid as its namesake hero. The creation of author Michael Connelly, good ol‚Äô Det. Hieronymus ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù Bosch (Titus Welliver) is a no-excuses cop who is haunted by his past, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it because he‚Äôs also incredibly businesslike. He‚Äôs not crippled by his obsessions nor addictions, he‚Äôs not a quirky savant with exceptional detecting skills, and he‚Äôs not in any way an obnoxious attention seeker.</p>

<p>Instead, his appeal is that he does his job without fanfare and as honestly and implacably as possible, while occasionally overextending himself. And so too does ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù the series. It‚Äôs why it was Amazon‚Äôs top-watched original series for several years until ‚ÄúSneaky Pete‚Äù sneaked in: ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù is so reliable in how pure and straightforward it is that a series-altering event in the first half of the season is actually shocking when it happens. More on this later, but we promise no spoilers.</p>

</div>

This show is hands down my favorite "nitty-gritty" detective show. I've enjoyed the past three seasons considerably, but this one that just dropped is not only equal in quality to its predecessors but exhibits some of the most compelling acting from its lead characters to date.

One of the best aspects of the show is the father-daughter relationship between "Harry" Bosch and Maddie, now an adult of 18 years. The basic goodness of their rapport and the depth of care they have for each another is a rare gem in TV storytelling. The Bosch duo is the heart of the show and a light that remains even in the midst of crime, corruption, and darkness.

<h2>How to Get Your Life Out of a Crisis Narrative</h2>

<p>Living daily as if everything around you is representative of constant warfare is a recipe for emotional and mental disaster. Trust me, I've been there.</p>

  <h2><cite><a href="https://treasures.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/treasures/messiah/" target="_blank">Handwritten Score from Handel‚Äôs Messiah</a></cite></h2>

  <p>The notes on these pages show Handel hastily adapting an aria in his most famous oratorio. He conducted performances from this score, including the first (in Dublin, 13 April 1742). It was copied from Handel‚Äôs original manuscript by his amanuensis, John Christopher Smith the Elder, but these two pages are wholly in the hand of the composer. Handel often altered the score to suit each performance, adding names of singers and new versions of some sections.</p>

</div>

Seeing an actual manuscript by Handel to one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written is something truly special (even if it's only in digital form).
