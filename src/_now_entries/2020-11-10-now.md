* I watched the Apple Silicon Macs keynote, and *wowee!* Those machines look like they're screaming fast. I expected a big boost (otherwise why bother to switch away from Intel?), but I didn't expact *that* much of a boost! Really tempted to pick up a new Mac mini…
* Just finished recording the next episode of the [**Fresh Fusion**](/podcast) podcast, which is the successor to The Jared White Show. Feeling really good about the new direction for the show and the reception thus far.
* I put up a new screenshare tutorial on how to configure template engines in the latest release of [**Bridgetown**](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), and that process went pretty well so I'm excited to start on another one soon.
* Still haven't gotten a [**Mark Up This!**](/newsletters) newsletter out the door yet…I'm hoping once I finish working on the Ruby programming blog I've been working on and get that launched, I'll be at a better cadance for writing in general.
