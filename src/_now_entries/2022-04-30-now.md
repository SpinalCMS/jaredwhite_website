* So much has been going on behind the scenes lately! [As you may have heard](/20220425/back-to-the-open-web), Twitter is imploding as Elon Musk tries to take it private, and I am **DONE** slaving away as a pawn of Big Tech and their [absurd notions](/links/20220426/not-interested) of content moderation (or lack thereof).
* Time to put the emphasis back where it belongs: real people publishing real content on real websites. [As I wrote in A Legacy of Words](/20220429/legacy-of-words), walled gardens have been attempting to capture digital words over the decades, and **they've failed**. The Open Web has been and shall ever be the digital space where lasting meaning and value is created.
* So I'm putting a ton of effort into upgrading this site in small but significant ways, as well as working on a brand-new website/blog specifically for a wide variety of web development topics called **The Spicy Web**. And I'll continue to write and podcast for **[Fullstack Ruby](https://www.fullstackruby.dev)** as well. In addition, I'm transitioning away from Revue for my email newsletter **[Creator Class](/creator-class)** and will be using [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) instead. They have a fantastic API which lets me can download issues and then post them right here on my site. This way all my issues will be saved here in perpetuity and _not_ siloed away in ConvertKit. _That_, my friends, is how you do the indie web!
* Last but not least, [I'm back on Mastodon](http://{{ site.metadata.social.mastodon }}) (aka _The Fediverse_). It should come as no surprise that I signed up using the [IndieWeb.social](https://indieweb.social) instance. Yup, definitely on-brand there! ðŸ˜… Anyway, come follow me there and let's enjoy using open web and open source technology to communicate together!
