## Hello and Welcome!

I’m Jared, _an award-winning_ essayist, **Rubyist**, and podcaster who’s been commenting on and building for the web since Mosaic was a thing. (Yup, it’s true! 😆)

In today's episode, I step through some follow-up and a few items of note I've been tracking (such as the gorgeous Nikon Z fc retro-style camera!) before kicking off a rant about the ways algorithms privilege the already privileged instead of favoring content off the beaten path. Apparently you're likely to do quite well on YouTube if you're young, white, cis, "attractive", and so forth…but what about the rest of us?

In my spare time I travel around Portland and the Pacific Northwest (pandemic lockdowns notwithstanding) and make artsy-fartsy videos. 📹 📺

This is my home on the internet. I hope you enjoy browsing around! 📍

P.S. You can find out more about me or subscribe to my occasional email newsletter.
